    "Description": "Affected versions of `node-sass` are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). Crafted objects passed to the `renderSync` function may trigger C++ assertions in `CustomImporterBridge::get_importer_entry` and `CustomImporterBridge::post_process_return_value` that crash the Node process. This may allow attackers to crash the system's running Node process and lead to Denial of Service.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 4.13.1 or later",
