    "Description": "Affected versions of `sencisho` are vulnerable to a directory traversal issue, giving an attacker access to the filesystem by placing \"../\" in the URL.\n\nExample request:\n```\nGET /../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nhost:foo\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is available for this vulnerability.\n\nIt is recommended that the package is only used for local development, and if the functionality is needed for production, a different package is used instead.",
