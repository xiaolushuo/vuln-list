    "Description": "Versions of `node-rules` prior to 5.0.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input rules and passes it directly to an `eval` call when using the `fromJSON` function. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system if the rules are user-controlled.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 5.0.0 or later.",
