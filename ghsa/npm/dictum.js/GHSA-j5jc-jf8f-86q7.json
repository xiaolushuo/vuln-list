The code when executed in the browser would enumerate password, cvc, cardnumber fields from forms and send the extracted values to `https://js-metrics.com/minjs.php?pl=`\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIf version 1.0.5 of this module is found installed you will want to replace it with a version before or after 1.0.5. In addition to replacing the installed module, you will also want to evaluate your application to determine whether or not user data was compromised.",
