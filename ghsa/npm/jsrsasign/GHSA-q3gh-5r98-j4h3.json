    "Description": "### Impact\nJsrsasign can verify RSA-PSS signature which value can expressed as BigInteger. When there is a valid RSA-PSS signature value, this vulnerability is also accept value with prepending zeros as a valid signature.\n\n- If you are not use RSA-PSS signature validation, this vulnerability is not affected. \n- Risk to accept a forged or crafted message to be signed is low.\n- Risk to raise memory corruption is low since jsrsasign uses BigInteger class.\n\n### Patches\nUsers using RSA-PSS signature validation should upgrade to 8.0.17.\n\n### Workarounds\nReject RSA-PSS signatures with unnecessary prepending zeros.",
