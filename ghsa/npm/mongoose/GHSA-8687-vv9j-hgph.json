    "Description": "Automattic Mongoose through 5.7.4 allows attackers to bypass access control (in some applications) because any query object with a _bsontype attribute is ignored. For example, adding \"_bsontype\":\"a\" can sometimes interfere with a query filter. NOTE: this CVE is about Mongoose's failure to work around this _bsontype special case that exists in older versions of the bson parser (aka the mongodb/js-bson project).",
