    "Description": "## Unauthorized File Access\r\n\r\nVersions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. It is possible for packages to create symlinks to files outside of the`node_modules` folder through the `bin` field upon installation. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to create a symlink pointing to arbitrary files on a user’s system when the package is installed.  \r\n\r\nThis behavior is possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.\r\n\r\nThank you Daniel Ruf for responsibly reporting the issue!\r\n\r\nFurther information: [npm blog post](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/189618601100/binary-planting-with-the-npm-cli)\r\n",
