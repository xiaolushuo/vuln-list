    "Description": "## Arbitrary File Overwrite\r\n\r\nVersions of  the npm CLI prior to 6.13.4 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Overwrite. It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by other package installations. For example, if a package was installed globally and created a `serve` binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create a `serve` binary would overwrite the previous `serve` binary.  \r\n\r\nThis behavior is still allowed in local installations and also through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.  \r\n\r\nThank you to Daniel Ruf for reporting the issue!\r\n\r\nFurther information: [npm blog post](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/189618601100/binary-planting-with-the-npm-cli)\r\n",
