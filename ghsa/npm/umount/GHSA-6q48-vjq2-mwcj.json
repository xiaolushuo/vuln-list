    "Description": "All versions of `umount` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input rules and passes it directly to an exec call on the umount function . This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system if the device value passed to the function is user-controlled.\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
