    "Description": "### Impact\nAn attacker with `write` permissions can upload an SVG file that contains malicious javascript. This javascript will be executed in a user's browser when the user is viewing that SVG file on the wiki.\n\n### Patches\nUsers are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version.\n\nMoinMoin Wiki 1.9.11 has the necessary fixes and also contains other important fixes.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is not advised to work around this, but to upgrade MoinMoin to a patched version.\n\nThat said, a work around via a Content Security Policy in the web server might be possible.\n\nAlso, it is of course helpful if you give `write` permissions (which include uploading attachments) only to trusted users.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email me at [twaldmann@thinkmo.de](mailto:twaldmann@thinkmo.de).\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\n\nCatarina Leite from the Checkmarx SCA AppSec team",
