    "Description": "## Keepalive thread overload/DoS\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nA poorly-behaved client could use keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service attack.\r\n\r\nIf more keepalive connections to Puma are opened than there are threads available, additional connections will wait permanently if the attacker sends requests frequently enough.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is patched in Puma 4.3.1 and 3.12.2.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nReverse proxies in front of Puma could be configured to always allow less than X keepalive connections to a Puma cluster or process, where X is the number of threads configured in Puma's thread pool.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n\r\n* Open an issue at [puma](github.com/puma/puma).\r\n\r\n",
