    "Description": "In ActiveSupport, there is potentially unexpected behaviour in the MemCacheStore and RedisCacheStore where, when\nuntrusted user input is written to the cache store using the `raw: true` parameter, re-reading the result\nfrom the cache can evaluate the user input as a Marshalled object instead of plain text. Vulnerable code looks like:\n\n```\ndata = cache.fetch(\"demo\", raw: true) { untrusted_string }\n```\nVersions Affected:  rails \u003c 5.2.5, rails \u003c 6.0.4\nNot affected:       Applications not using MemCacheStore or RedisCacheStore. Applications that do not use the `raw` option when storing untrusted user input.\nFixed Versions:     rails \u003e= 5.2.4.3, rails \u003e= 6.0.3.1\n  \nImpact\n------\nUnmarshalling of untrusted user input can have impact up to and including RCE. At a minimum,\nthis vulnerability allows an attacker to inject untrusted Ruby objects into a web application.\nIn addition to upgrading to the latest versions of Rails, developers should ensure that whenever\nthey are calling `Rails.cache.fetch` they are using consistent values of the `raw` parameter for both\nreading and writing, especially in the case of the RedisCacheStore which does not, prior to these changes,\ndetect if data was serialized using the raw option upon deserialization.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nIt is recommended that application developers apply the suggested patch or upgrade to the latest release as\nsoon as possible. If this is not possible, we recommend ensuring that all user-provided strings cached using\nthe `raw` argument should be double-checked to ensure that they conform to the expected format.",
