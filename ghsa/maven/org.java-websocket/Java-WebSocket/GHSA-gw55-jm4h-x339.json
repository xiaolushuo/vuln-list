    "Description": "The Java-WebSocket Client does not perform hostname verification.\n\nThis means that SSL certificates of other hosts are accepted as long as they are trusted. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker has to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack between a Java application using the Java-WebSocket Client and an WebSocket server it's connecting to.\n\nTLS normally protects users and systems against MITM attacks, it cannot if certificates from other trusted hosts are accepted by the client.
