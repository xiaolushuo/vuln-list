    "Description": "The SourceHttpMessageConverter in Spring MVC in Spring Framework before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0.M1 through 4.0.0.RC1 does not disable external entity resolution, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, and conduct CSRF attacks via crafted XML, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue, and a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-4152 and CVE-2013-7315.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2857\nIt was discovered by the Spring development team that the fix for the\nXML External Entity (XXE) Injection \n(\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4152\"\u003e\\\nCVE-2013-4152\u003c/a\u003e) in the Spring Framework was incomplete.\nSpring MVC's SourceHttpMessageConverter also processed user provided XML\nand neither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to\ndisable them. SourceHttpMessageConverter has been modified to provide an\noption to control the processing of XML external entities and that\nprocessing is now disabled by default.\nIn addition Jon Passki discovered a possible XSS vulnerability:\nThe JavaScriptUtils.javaScriptEscape() method did not escape all\ncharacters that are sensitive within either a JS single quoted string,\nJS double quoted string, or HTML script data context. In most cases this\nwill result in an unexploitable parse error but in some cases it could\nresult in an XSS vulnerability.\n"
