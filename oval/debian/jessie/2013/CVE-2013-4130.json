    "Description": "The (1) red_channel_pipes_add_type and (2) red_channel_pipes_add_empty_msg functions in server/red_channel.c in SPICE before 0.12.4 do not properly perform ring loops, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reachable assertion and server exit) by triggering a network error.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2839\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been found in spice, a SPICE protocol\nclient and server library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following issues:\nDavid Gibson of Red Hat discovered that SPICE incorrectly handled\n  certain network errors. A remote user able to initiate a SPICE\n  connection to an application acting as a SPICE server could use this\n  flaw to crash the application.\nTomas Jamrisko of Red Hat discovered that SPICE incorrectly handled\n  long passwords in SPICE tickets. A remote user able to initiate a\n  SPICE connection to an application acting as a SPICE server could use\n  this flaw to crash the application.\nApplications acting as a SPICE server must be restarted for this update\nto take effect.\n"
