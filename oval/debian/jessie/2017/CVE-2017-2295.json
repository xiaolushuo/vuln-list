    "Description": "Versions of Puppet prior to 4.10.1 will deserialize data off the wire (from the agent to the server, in this case) with a attacker-specified format. This could be used to force YAML deserialization in an unsafe manner, which would lead to remote code execution. This change constrains the format of data on the wire to PSON or safely decoded YAML.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3862\nIt was discovered that unrestricted YAML deserialisation of data sent\nfrom agents to the server in the Puppet configuration management system\ncould result in the execution of arbitrary code.\nNote that this fix breaks backward compability with Puppet agents older\nthan 3.2.2 and there is no safe way to restore it. This affects puppet\nagents running on Debian wheezy; we recommend to update to the\npuppet version shipped in wheezy-backports.\n"
