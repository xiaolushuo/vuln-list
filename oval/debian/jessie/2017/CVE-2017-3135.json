    "Description": "Under some conditions when using both DNS64 and RPZ to rewrite query responses, query processing can resume in an inconsistent state leading to either an INSIST assertion failure or an attempt to read through a NULL pointer. Affects BIND 9.8.8, 9.9.3-S1 -\u003e 9.9.9-S7, 9.9.3 -\u003e 9.9.9-P5, 9.9.10b1, 9.10.0 -\u003e 9.10.4-P5, 9.10.5b1, 9.11.0 -\u003e 9.11.0-P2, 9.11.1b1.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3795\nIt was discovered that a maliciously crafted query can cause ISC's\nBIND DNS server (named) to crash if both Response Policy Zones (RPZ)\nand DNS64 (a bridge between IPv4 and IPv6 networks) are enabled.  It\nis uncommon for both of these options to be used in combination, so\nvery few systems will be affected by this problem in practice.\nThis update also corrects an additional regression caused by the fix\nfor \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8864\"\u003eCVE-2016-8864\u003c/a\u003e,\nwhich was applied in a previous security update.\n"
