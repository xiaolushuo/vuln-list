    "Description": "Two four letter word commands \"wchp/wchc\" are CPU intensive and could cause spike of CPU utilization on Apache ZooKeeper server if abused, which leads to the server unable to serve legitimate client requests. Apache ZooKeeper thru version 3.4.9 and 3.5.2 suffer from this issue, fixed in 3.4.10, 3.5.3, and later.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3871\nIt was discovered that Zookeeper, a service for maintaining\nconfiguration information, didn't restrict access to the computationally\nexpensive wchp/wchc commands which could result in denial of service by\nelevated CPU consumption.\nThis update disables those two commands by default. The new\nconfiguration option \u003cq\u003e4lw.commands.whitelist\u003c/q\u003e can be used to whitelist\ncommands selectively (and the full set of commands can be restored\nwith '*')\n"
