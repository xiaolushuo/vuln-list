    "Description": "When parsing the AIA-Extension field of a client certificate, Apache Tomcat Native Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.1.23 to 1.1.34 did not correctly handle fields longer than 127 bytes. The result of the parsing error was to skip the OCSP check. It was therefore possible for client certificates that should have been rejected (if the OCSP check had been made) to be accepted. Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4118\nJonas Klempel reported that tomcat-native, a library giving Tomcat\naccess to the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library's network connection\n(socket) implementation and random-number generator, does not properly\nhandle fields longer than 127 bytes when parsing the AIA-Extension field\nof a client certificate. If OCSP checks are used, this could result in\nclient certificates that should have been rejected to be accepted.\n"
