    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Irssi before 1.0.4. When receiving messages with invalid time stamps, Irssi would try to dereference a NULL pointer.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4016\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Irssi, a terminal based\nIRC client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\nBrian \u003cq\u003egeeknik\u003c/q\u003e Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi does\n    not properly handle receiving messages with invalid time stamps. A\n    malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi\n    to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\nBrian \u003cq\u003egeeknik\u003c/q\u003e Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi is\n    susceptible to a use-after-free flaw triggered while updating the\n    internal nick list. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of\n    this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\nJoseph Bisch discovered that while waiting for the channel\n    synchronisation, Irssi may incorrectly fail to remove destroyed\n    channels from the query list, resulting in use after free conditions\n    when updating the state later on. A malicious IRC server can take\n    advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a\n    denial of service.\nHanno Boeck reported that Irssi does not properly handle installing\n    themes with unterminated colour formatting sequences, leading to a\n    denial of service if a user is tricked into installing a specially\n    crafted theme.\nJoseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly handle\n    incorrectly formatted DCC CTCP messages. A remote attacker can take\n    advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a\n    denial of service.\nJoseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly verify Safe\n    channel IDs. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw\n    to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\nJoseph Bisch reported that Irssi does not properly handle overlong\n    nicks or targets resulting in a NULL pointer dereference when\n    splitting the message and leading to a denial of service.\n"
