    "Description": "libndp before 1.6, as used in NetworkManager, does not properly validate the origin of Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) messages, which allows remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or cause a denial of service (network connectivity disruption) by advertising a node as a router from a non-local network.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3581\nJulien Bernard discovered that libndp, a library for the IPv6 Neighbor\nDiscovery Protocol, does not properly perform input and origin checks\nduring the reception of a NDP message. An attacker in a non-local\nnetwork could use this flaw to advertise a node as a router, and cause a\ndenial of service attack, or act as a man-in-the-middle.\n"
