    "Description": "The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an \"httpoxy\" issue.  NOTE: the vendor states \"This mitigation has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387\"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3623\nScott Geary of VendHQ discovered that the Apache HTTPD server used the\nvalue of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the\nHTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was\nincorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the\nproxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an\nattacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.\n"
