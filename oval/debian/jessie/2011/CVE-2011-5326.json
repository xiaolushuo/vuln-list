Kaminskiy discovered that drawing using coordinates from\n    an untrusted source could lead to an out-of-bound memory read, which\n    in turn could result in an application crash.\nJakub Wilk discovered that a malformed image could lead to an\n    out-of-bound read in the GIF loader, which may result in an\n    application crash or information leak.\nYuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered an integer overflow that could lead to\n    an insufficient heap allocation and out-of-bound memory write.\n"
