Since the \u003cq\u003eTMP\u003c/q\u003e feature was originally implemented,\nGraphicsMagick added a temporary file management subsystem which assures\nthat temporary files are removed so this feature is not needed.\nRemove support for reading input from a shell command, or writing output\nto a shell command, by prefixing the specified filename (containing the\ncommand) with a '|' for fixing the\n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5118\"\u003eCVE-2016-5118\u003c/a\u003e\nvulnerability.\nGustavo Grieco discovered an out of bound read in the parsing of GIF\n    files which may cause denial of service.\nGustavo Grieco discovered a stack buffer overflow and two heap buffer\n    overflows while processing SVG images which may cause denial of service.\nGustavo Grieco discovered several segmentation faults while processing\n    SVG images which may cause denial of service.\nGustavo Grieco discovered an endless loop problem caused by negative\n    stroke-dasharray arguments while parsing SVG files which may cause\n    denial of service.\nMarco Grassi discovered an unsigned underflow leading to heap overflow\n    when parsing 8BIM chunk often attached to JPG files which may cause\n    denial of service.\nMoshe Kaplan discovered that there is no check that the provided\n    colormap is not larger than 256 entries in the WPG reader which may\n    cause denial of service.\nMoshe Kaplan discovered that an assertion is thrown for some files in\n    the WPG reader due to a logic error which may cause denial of service.\nAgostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a stack buffer read overflow\n    while reading the SCT header which may cause denial of service.\nAgostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the\n    PCX coder which may cause denial of service.\nAgostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the\n    SGI coder which may cause denial of service.\nAgostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in\n    MagickRealloc() function which may cause denial of service.\n"
