    "Description": "The chunked transfer coding implementation in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.14 does not properly parse chunk headers, which allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks via a crafted request, related to mishandling of large chunk-size values and invalid chunk-extension characters in modules/http/http_filters.c.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3325\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.\nAn HTTP request smuggling attack was possible due to a bug in\n    parsing of chunked requests. A malicious client could force the\n    server to misinterpret the request length, allowing cache poisoning\n    or credential hijacking if an intermediary proxy is in use.\nA design error in the \u003cq\u003eap_some_auth_required\u003c/q\u003e function renders the\n    API unusuable in apache2 2.4.x. This could lead to modules using\n    this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so.\n    The fix backports the new \u003cq\u003eap_some_authn_required\u003c/q\u003e API from 2.4.16.\n    This issue does not affect the oldstable distribution (wheezy).\nIn addition, the updated package for the oldstable distribution (wheezy)\nremoves a limitation of the Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters to 1024 bits.\nThis limitation may potentially allow an attacker with very large\ncomputing resources, like a nation-state, to break DH key exchange by\nprecomputation. The updated apache2 package also allows to configure\ncustom DH parameters. More information is contained in the\nchangelog.Debian.gz file.\nThese improvements were already present in the stable, testing, and\nunstable distributions.\n"
