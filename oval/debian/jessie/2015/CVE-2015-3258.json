    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the WriteProlog function in filter/texttopdf.c in texttopdf in cups-filters before 1.0.70 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a small line size in a print job.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3303\nIt was discovered that the texttopdf utility, part of cups-filters, was\nsusceptible to multiple heap-based buffer overflows due to improper\nhandling of print jobs with a specially crafted line size. This could\nallow remote attackers to crash texttopdf or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode.\n"
