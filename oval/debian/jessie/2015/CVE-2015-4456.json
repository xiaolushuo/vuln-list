      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3363\nJohannes Kliemann discovered a vulnerability in ownCloud Desktop Client,\nthe client-side of the ownCloud file sharing services. The vulnerability\nallows man-in-the-middle attacks in situations where the server is using\nself-signed certificates and the connection is already established. If\nthe user in the client side manually distrusts the new certificate, the\nfile syncing will continue using the malicious server as valid.\n"
