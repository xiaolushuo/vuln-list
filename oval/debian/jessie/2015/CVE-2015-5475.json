      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3335\nIt was discovered that Request Tracker, an extensible trouble-ticket\ntracking system is susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack via the\nuser and group rights management pages (\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5475\"\u003eCVE-2015-5475\u003c/a\u003e) and via the\ncryptography interface, allowing an attacker with a carefully-crafted\nkey to inject JavaScript into RT's user interface. Installations which\nuse neither GnuPG nor S/MIME are unaffected by the second cross-site\nscripting vulnerability.\n"
