    "Description": "cURL and libcurl 7.10.6 through 7.41.0 does not properly re-use NTLM connections, which allows remote attackers to connect as other users via an unauthenticated request, a similar issue to CVE-2014-0015.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3232\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library:\nNTLM-authenticated connections could be wrongly reused for requests\n    without any credentials set, leading to HTTP requests being sent\n    over the connection authenticated as a different user. This is\n    similar to the issue fixed in DSA-2849-1.\nWhen parsing URLs with a zero-length hostname (such as \"http://:80\"),\n    libcurl would try to read from an invalid memory address. This could\n    allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash). This\n    issue only affects the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid)\n    distributions.\nWhen parsing HTTP cookies, if the parsed cookie's \u003cq\u003epath\u003c/q\u003e element\n    consists of a single double-quote, libcurl would try to write to an\n    invalid heap memory address. This could allow remote attackers to\n    cause a denial of service (crash). This issue only affects the\n    upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions.\nWhen doing HTTP requests using the Negotiate authentication method\n    along with NTLM, the connection used would not be marked as\n    authenticated, making it possible to reuse it and send requests for\n    one user over the connection authenticated as a different user.\n"
