    "Description": "The dtls1_clear_queues function in ssl/d1_lib.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h frees data structures without considering that application data can arrive between a ChangeCipherSpec message and a Finished message, which allows remote DTLS peers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unexpected application data.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3287\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Sockets\nLayer toolkit.\nPraveen Kariyanahalli, Ivan Fratric and Felix Groebert discovered\n    that an invalid memory free could be triggered when buffering DTLS\n    data. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n    (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code. This issue only\n    affected the oldstable distribution (wheezy).\nJoseph Barr-Pixton discovered that an infinite loop could be triggered\n    due to incorrect handling of malformed ECParameters structures. This\n    could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service.\nRobert Swiecki and Hanno BĂśck discovered that the X509_cmp_time\n    function could read a few bytes out of bounds. This could allow remote\n    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted\n    certificates and CRLs.\nMichal Zalewski discovered that the PKCS#7 parsing code did not\n    properly handle missing content which could lead to a NULL pointer\n    dereference. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of\n    service (crash) via crafted ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs.\nEmilia KĂ¤sper discovered that a race condition could occur due to\n    incorrect handling of NewSessionTicket in a multi-threaded client,\n    leading to a double free. This could allow remote attackers to cause\n    a denial of service (crash).\nJohannes Bauer discovered that the CMS code could enter an infinite\n    loop when verifying a signedData message, if presented with an\n    unknown hash function OID. This could allow remote attackers to cause\n    a denial of service.\nAdditionally OpenSSL will now reject handshakes using DH parameters\n\tshorter than 768 bits as a countermeasure against the Logjam attack\n\t(\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4000\"\u003eCVE-2015-4000\u003c/a\u003e).\n"
