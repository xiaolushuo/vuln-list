    "Description": "The ssl_decrypt_buf function in library/ssl_tls.c in PolarSSL before 1.2.11 and 1.3.x before 1.3.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors related to the GCM ciphersuites, as demonstrated using the Codenomicon Defensics toolkit.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2981\nA flaw was discovered in PolarSSL, a lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS\nlibrary, which can be exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker to\nmount a denial of service against PolarSSL servers that offer GCM\nciphersuites. Potentially clients are affected too if a malicious server\ndecides to execute the denial of service attack against its clients.\n"
