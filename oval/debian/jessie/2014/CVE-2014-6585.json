    "Description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 5.0u75, 6u85, 7u72, and 8u25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via unknown vectors related to 2D, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-6591.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3323\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the International Components\nfor Unicode (ICU) library.\nThe Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation does not properly\n    track directionally isolated pieces of text, which allows remote\n    attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow)\n    or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted text.\nThe Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation uses an integer\n    data type that is inconsistent with a header file, which allows\n    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect malloc\n    followed by invalid free) or possibly execute arbitrary code via\n    crafted text.\nThe Layout Engine was missing multiple boundary checks. These could\n    lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption. A specially crafted\n    file could cause an application using ICU to parse untrusted font\n    files to crash and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\nAdditionally, it was discovered that the patch applied to ICU in DSA-3187-1\nfor \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-6585\"\u003eCVE-2014-6585\u003c/a\u003e was incomplete, possibly leading to an invalid memory\naccess. This could allow remote attackers to disclose portion of private\nmemory via crafted font files.\n"
