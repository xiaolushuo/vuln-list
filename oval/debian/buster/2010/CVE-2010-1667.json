The following Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project ids identify them:\nMultiple pages performed insufficient input sanitising, making them\n    vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.\nMultiple forms lacked protection against cross-site request forgery\n    attacks, therefore making them vulnerable.\nGregor Anzelj discovered that it was possible to accidentally\n    configure an installation of mahara that allows access to another\n    user's account without a password.\nCertain Internet Explorer-specific cross-site scripting\n    vulnerabilities were discovered in HTML Purifier, of which a copy\n    is included in the mahara package.\n"
