Cookie\n  files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names, and the vulnerability\n  allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files the users has\n  write permissions for, and are also world-readable which may cause\n  information leak.\nJakub Wilk discovered an unsafe management of temporary files during the\n  build process. Files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names, and the\n  vulnerability allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files\n  the users has write permissions for.\n"
