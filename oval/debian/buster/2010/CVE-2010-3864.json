    "Description": "Multiple race conditions in ssl/t1_lib.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8f through 0.9.8o, 1.0.0, and 1.0.0a, when multi-threading and internal caching are enabled on a TLS server, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via client data that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, related to (1) the TLS server name extension and (2) elliptic curve cryptography.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2125\nA flaw has been found in the OpenSSL TLS server extension code parsing\nwhich on affected servers can be exploited in a buffer overrun attack.\nThis allows an attacker to cause an application crash or potentially to\nexecute arbitrary code.\nHowever, not all OpenSSL based SSL/TLS servers are vulnerable: a server\nis vulnerable if it is multi-threaded and uses OpenSSL's internal caching\nmechanism.  In particular the Apache HTTP server (which never uses OpenSSL\ninternal caching) and Stunnel (which includes its own workaround) are NOT\naffected.\nThis upgrade fixes this issue. After the upgrade, any services using the\nopenssl libraries need to be restarted. The checkrestart script from the\ndebian-goodies package or lsof can help to find out which services need\nto be restarted.\nA note to users of the tor packages from the Debian backports or Debian\nvolatile: this openssl update causes problems with some versions of tor.\nYou need to update to tor 0.2.1.26-4~bpo50+1 or 0.2.1.26-1~lennyvolatile2,\nrespectively. The tor package version 0.2.0.35-1~lenny2 from Debian stable\nis not affected by these problems.\n"
