      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2115\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Moodle, a\ncourse management system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nMoodle does not enable the \u003cq\u003eRegenerate session id during\n\tlogin\u003c/q\u003e setting by default, which makes it easier for remote\n\tattackers to conduct session fixation attacks.\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow\n\tremote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via\n\tvectors related to (1) the Login-As feature or (2) when the\n\tglobal search feature is enabled, unspecified global search\n\tforms in the Global Search Engine.\nMultiple SQL injection vulnerabilities allow remote attackers\n\tto execute arbitrary SQL commands via vectors related to (1)\n\tthe add_to_log function in mod/wiki/view.php in the wiki\n\tmodule, or (2) \u003cq\u003edata validation in some forms elements\u003c/q\u003e\n\trelated to lib/form/selectgroups.php.\nMoodle can create new roles when restoring a course, which\n\tallows teachers to create new accounts even if they do not\n\thave the moodle/user:create capability.\nuser/view.php does not properly check a role, which allows\n\tremote authenticated users to obtain the full names of other\n\tusers via the course profile page.\nA Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the phpCAS\n\tclient library allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web\n\tscript or HTML via a crafted URL, which is not properly\n\thandled in an error message.\nA Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the\n\tfix_non_standard_entities function in the KSES HTML text\n\tcleaning library (weblib.php) allows remote attackers to\n\tinject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted HTML entities.\nA Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the MNET\n\taccess-control interface allows remote attackers to inject\n\tarbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving extended\n\tcharacters in a username.\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in\n\tblog/index.php allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web\n\tscript or HTML via unspecified parameters.\nThe KSES text cleaning filter in lib/weblib.php does\n\tnot properly handle vbscript URIs, which allows remote\n\tauthenticated users to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)\n\tattacks via HTML input.\nA Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in\n\treport/overview/report.php in the quiz module allows remote\n\tattackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users for\n\trequests that delete quiz attempts via the attemptid\n\tparameter.\nThis security update switches to a new upstream version and requires\ndatabase updates.  After installing the fixed package, you must visit\n\u0026lt;http://localhost/moodle/admin/\u0026gt; and follow the update instructions.\n"
