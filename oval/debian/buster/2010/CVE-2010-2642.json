    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the AFM font parser in the dvi-backend component in Evince 2.32 and earlier, teTeX 3.0, t1lib 5.1.2, and possibly other products allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted font in conjunction with a DVI file that is processed by the thumbnailer.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2388\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in t1lib, a Postscript Type 1\nfont rasterizer library, some of which might lead to code execution\nthrough the opening of files embedding bad fonts.\nA heap-based buffer overflow in the AFM font metrics parser\n\tpotentially leads to the execution of arbitrary code.\nAnother heap-based buffer overflow in the AFM font metrics\n\tparser potentially leads to the execution of arbitrary code.\nAn invalid pointer dereference allows execution of arbitrary\n\tcode using crafted Type 1 fonts.\nAnother invalid pointer dereference results in an application\n\tcrash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.\nA use-after-free vulnerability results in an application\n\tcrash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.\nAn off-by-one error results in an invalid memory read and\n\tapplication crash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.\n"
