The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nInadequate enforcement of fixed-length buffer limits allows an\n    attacker to overflow a buffer on the stack, potentially enabling\n    the execution of arbitrary code when a maliciously-crafted\n    image is opened.\nAn integer sign error in reading image gamma data could allow an\n    attacker to cause an under-sized buffer to be allocated for\n    subsequent image data, with unknown consequences potentially\n    including the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously-crafted\n    image is opened.\n"
