      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1879\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the software suite for the\nSILC protocol, a network protocol designed to provide end-to-end security\nfor conferencing services.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nAn incorrect format string in sscanf() used in the ASN1 encoder to scan an\nOID value could overwrite a neighbouring variable on the stack as the\ndestination data type is smaller than the source type on 64-bit. On 64-bit\narchitectures this could result in unexpected application behaviour or even\ncode execution in some cases.\nVarious format string vulnerabilities when handling parsed SILC messages\nallow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the victim\nrunning the SILC client via crafted nick names or channel names containing\nformat strings.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-7160\"\u003eCVE-2008-7160\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn incorrect format string in a sscanf() call used in the HTTP server\ncomponent of silcd could result in overwriting a neighbouring variable on\nthe stack as the destination data type is smaller than the source type on\n64-bit.  An attacker could exploit this by using crafted Content-Length\nheader values resulting in unexpected application behaviour or even code\nexecution in some cases.\nsilc-server doesn't need an update as it uses the shared library provided\nby silc-toolkit. silc-client/silc-toolkit in the oldstable distribution\n(etch) is not affected by this problem.\n"
