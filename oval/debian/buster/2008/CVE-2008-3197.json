The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nRemote authenticated users could execute arbitrary code on the\n    host running phpMyAdmin through manipulation of a script parameter.\nCross site scripting through the setup script was possible in\n    rare circumstances.\nProtection has been added against remote websites loading phpMyAdmin\n    into a frameset.\nCross site request forgery allowed remote attackers to create a new\n    database, but not perform any other action on it.\n"
