      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1697\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceape an\nunbranded version of the Seamonkey internet suite. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nJustin Schuh, Tom Cross and Peter Williams discovered a buffer\n   overflow in the parser for UTF-8 URLs, which may lead to the\n   execution of arbitrary code. (MFSA 2008-37)\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow in MIME decoding can lead\n    to the execution of arbitrary code. (MFSA 2008-26)\nIt was discovered that missing boundary checks on a reference\n    counter for CSS objects can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n    (MFSA 2008-34)\nDevon Hubbard, Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers discovered\n    crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of\n    arbitrary code. (MFSA 2008-21)\nIgor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman and Gary Kwong discovered crashes in\n    the Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary\n    code. (MFSA 2008-21)\n\"moz_bug_r_a4\" discovered several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.\n    (MFSA 2008-22)\nCollin Jackson and Adam Barth discovered that Javascript code\n    could be executed in the context or signed JAR archives. (MFSA 2008-23)\n\"moz_bug_r_a4\" discovered that XUL documements can escalate\n    privileges by accessing the pre-compiled \"fastload\" file.\n    (MFSA 2008-24)\n\"moz_bug_r_a4\" discovered that missing input sanitising in the\n    mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript() function could lead to the\n    execution of arbitrary code. Iceape itself is not affected, but\n    some addons are.

(MFSA 2008-27)\nDaniel Glazman discovered that a programming error in the code for\n    parsing .properties files could lead to memory content being\n    exposed to addons, which could lead to information disclosure.\n    (MFSA 2008-29)\nMasahiro Yamada discovered that file URLs in directory listings\n    were insufficiently escaped. (MFSA 2008-30)\nJohn G. Myers, Frank Benkstein and Nils Toedtmann discovered that\n    alternate names on self-signed certificates were handled\n    insufficiently, which could lead to spoofings of secure connections.\n    (MFSA 2008-31)\nIt was discovered that URL shortcut files could be used to bypass the\n   same-origin restrictions. This issue does not affect current Iceape,\n   but might occur with additional extensions installed.

(MFSA 2008-42)\nDave Reed discovered that some Unicode byte order marks are\n   stripped from Javascript code before execution, which can result in\n   code being executed, which were otherwise part of a quoted string.\n   (MFSA 2008-43)\nBoris Zbarsky discovered that resource: URLs allow directory\n   traversal when using URL-encoded slashes. (MFSA 2008-44)\nGeorgi Guninski discovered that resource: URLs could bypass local\n   access restrictions.
