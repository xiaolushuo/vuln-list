    "Description": "The JK Connector (aka mod_jk) 1.2.0 through 1.2.26 in Apache Tomcat allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an arbitrary request from an HTTP client, in opportunistic circumstances involving (1) a request from a different client that included a Content-Length header but no POST data or (2) a rapid series of requests, related to noncompliance with the AJP protocol's requirements for requests containing Content-Length headers.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1810\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in mod_jk, the Tomcat Connector\nmodule for Apache. If a buggy client included the \"Content-Length\" header\nwithout providing request body data, or if a client sent repeated \nrequests very quickly, one client could obtain a response intended for\nanother client.\nThe oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:1.2.18-3etch2.\n"
