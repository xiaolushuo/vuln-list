The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nDrew Yao discovered that multiple integer overflows in the MP4 demuxer,\nReal demuxer and Cinepak codec can lead to the execution of arbitrary\ncode.\nDrew Yao discovered that the Cinepak codec is prone to a memory\ncorruption, which can be triggered by a crafted Cinepak file.\nLuigi Auriemma discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary code\nvia a long subtitle in an SSA file.\nIt was discovered that vlc is prone to a search path vulnerability,\nwhich allows local users to perform privilege escalations.\nAlin Rad Pop discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary code\nwhen opening a WAV file containing a large fmt chunk.\nPÄąnar Yanarda\u0026#287; discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary code\nwhen opening a crafted mmst link.\nTobias Klein discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary code\nwhen opening a crafted .ty file.\nTobias Klein discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary code\nwhen opening an invalid CUE image file with a crafted header.\n"
