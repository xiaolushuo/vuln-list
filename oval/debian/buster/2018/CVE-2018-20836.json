    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.20. There is a race condition in smp_task_timedout() and smp_task_done() in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_expander.c, leading to a use-after-free.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4495\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\nchenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel\n    subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which\n    could lead to a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this might be\n    exploited.\nIt was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively\n    skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the\n    kernel from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when\n    it should be skipped.  This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1,\n    which could allow local users to obtain sensitive information from\n    the kernel or other processes.  It has been mitigated by using\n    memory barriers to limit speculative execution.  Systems using an\n    i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS.\nA race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver,\n    which could lead to a use-after-free.  If this driver is loaded, a\n    local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service\n    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.\nThe syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various\n    drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters.  A local user with\n    access to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this\n    for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).\nAmit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP\n    packet IDs used a weak hash function, \u003cq\u003ejhash\u003c/q\u003e.  This could enable\n    tracking individual computers as they communicate with different\n    remote servers and from different networks.  The \u003cq\u003esiphash\u003c/q\u003e\n    function is now used instead.\nIt was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the\n    hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a\n    process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB.  This could\n    lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of\n    memory between user processes.  A local user could use this for\n    privilege escalation.  Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom\n    kernel with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected.\nIt was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not\n    properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading\n    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user on a system with an\n    NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).\nJann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture,\n    in use of the LDT.  This could lead to a use-after-free.  A\n    local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service.\nIt was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could\n    overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's\n    descriptor.  A physically present user with a specially\n    constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service\n    (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation.\nPraveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without\n    Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to\n    restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call.  A local\n    user could use this for denial-of-service (oops).\nThe syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk\n    driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a\n    disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the\n    I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information.\nThe syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the\n    floppy disk driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk\n    device could use this for denial-of-service (oops).\n"
