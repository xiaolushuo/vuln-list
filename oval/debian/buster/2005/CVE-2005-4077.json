    "Description": "Multiple off-by-one errors in the cURL library (libcurl) 7.11.2 through 7.15.0 allow local users to trigger a buffer overflow and cause a denial of service or bypass PHP security restrictions via certain URLs that (1) are malformed in a way that prevents a terminating null byte from being added to either a hostname or path buffer, or (2) contain a \"?\"  separator in the hostname portion, which causes a \"/\" to be prepended to the resulting string.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-919\nThe upstream developer of curl, a multi-protocol file transfer\nlibrary, informed us that the former correction to several off-by-one\nerrors are not sufficient.  For completeness please find the original\nbug description below:\nSeveral problems were discovered in libcurl, a multi-protocol file\ntransfer library.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nA buffer overflow has been discovered in libcurl\n    that could allow the execution of arbitrary code.\nStefan Esser discovered several off-by-one errors that allows\n    local users to trigger a buffer overflow and cause a denial of\n    service or bypass PHP security restrictions via certain URLs.\n"
