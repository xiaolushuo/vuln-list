    "Description": "PowerDNS before 2.9.18, when running with an LDAP backend, does not properly escape LDAP queries, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (failure to answer ldap questions) and possibly conduct an LDAP injection attack.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-771\nSeveral problems have been discovered in pdns, a versatile nameserver\nthat can lead to a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\nNorbert Sendetzky and Jan de Groot discovered that the LDAP backend\n    did not properly escape all queries, allowing it to fail and not\n    answer queries anymore.\nWilco Baan discovered that queries from clients without recursion\n    permission can temporarily blank out domains to clients with\n    recursion permitted.  This enables outside users to blank out a\n    domain temporarily to normal users.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pdns packages.\n"
