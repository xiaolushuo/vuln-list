This vulnerability could lead to the\nexecution of arbitrary commands on the server running phpgroupware.\nThe security team is continuing to investigate the version of\nphpgroupware included with the old stable distribution (woody). At this\ntime we recommend disabling phpgroupware or upgrading to the current\nstable distribution (sarge).\nDSA-745\nTwo input validation errors were discovered in drupal and its bundled\nxmlrpc module. These errors can lead to the execution of arbitrary\ncommands on the web server running drupal.\ndrupal was not included in the old stable distribution (woody).\n"
