      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-763\nMarkus Oberhumer discovered a flaw in the way zlib, a library used for\nfile compression and decompression, handles invalid input. This flaw can\ncause programs which use zlib to crash when opening an invalid file.\nThis problem does not affect the old stable distribution (woody).\nDSA-797\nzsync, a file transfer program, includes a modified local copy of\nthe zlib library, and is vulnerable to certain bugs fixed previously\nin the zlib package.\nThere was a build error for the sarge i386 proftpd packages released in\nDSA 797-1. A new build, zsync_0.3.3-1.sarge.1.2, has been prepared to\ncorrect this error. The packages for other architectures are unaffected.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the zsync\npackage.\nDSA-1026\nMarkus Oberhumer discovered a flaw in the way zlib, a library used for\nfile compression and decompression, handles invalid input. This flaw can\ncause programs which use zlib to crash when opening an invalid file.\nA further error in the way zlib handles the inflation of certain\ncompressed files can cause a program which uses zlib to crash when opening\nan invalid file.\nsash, the stand-alone shell, links statically against zlib, and was\nthus affected by these problems.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) isn't affected by these problems.\n"
