      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2342\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Iceape internet suite, an\nunbranded version of Seamonkey:\n\u003cq\u003emoz_bug_r_a4\u003c/q\u003e discovered a privilege escalation vulnerability in\n   addon handling.\nYosuke Hasegawa discovered that incorrect handling of Shift-JIS\n   encodings could lead to cross-site scripting.\nMarc Schoenefeld discovered that profiling the JavaScript code\n   could lead to memory corruption.\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package only\nprovides the XPCOM code.\nDSA-2341\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web browser\nbased on Firefox. The included XULRunner library provides rendering\nservices for several other applications included in Debian.\n\u003cq\u003emoz_bug_r_a4\u003c/q\u003e discovered a privilege escalation vulnerability in\n   addon handling.\nYosuke Hasegawa discovered that incorrect handling of Shift-JIS\n   encodings could lead to cross-site scripting.\nMarc Schoenefeld discovered that profiling the JavaScript code\n   could lead to memory corruption.\nDSA-2345\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, a mail client\nbased on Thunderbird.\nThe JSSubScriptLoader does not properly handle\n        XPCNativeWrappers during calls to the loadSubScript method in\n        an add-on, which makes it easier for remote attackers to gain\n        privileges via a crafted web site that leverages certain\n        unwrapping behavior.\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote\n\tattackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted\n\ttext with Shift JIS encoding.\nIceweasel does not properly handle JavaScript files that\n\tcontain many functions, which allows user-assisted remote\n\tattackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and\n\tapplication crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact\n\tvia a crafted file that is accessed by debugging APIs, as\n\tdemonstrated by Firebug.\n"
