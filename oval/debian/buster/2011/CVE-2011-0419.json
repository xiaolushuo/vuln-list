    "Description": "Stack consumption vulnerability in the fnmatch implementation in apr_fnmatch.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library before 1.4.3 and the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.18, and in fnmatch.c in libc in NetBSD 5.1, OpenBSD 4.8, FreeBSD, Apple Mac OS X 10.6, Oracle Solaris 10, and Android, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via *? sequences in the first argument, as demonstrated by attacks against mod_autoindex in httpd.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2237\nA flaw was found in the APR library, which could be exploited through\nApache HTTPD's mod_autoindex.  If a directory indexed by mod_autoindex\ncontained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could\nsend a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU\nusage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.\n"
