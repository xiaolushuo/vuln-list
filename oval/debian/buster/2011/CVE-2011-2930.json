    "Description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the quote_table_name method in the ActiveRecord adapters in activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/ in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.13, 3.0.x before 3.0.10, and 3.1.x before 3.1.0.rc5 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a crafted column name.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2301\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web\napplication framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the\n    strip_tags function. An attacker may inject non-printable characters\n    that certain browsers will then evaluate. This vulnerability only\n    affects the oldstable distribution (lenny).\nA SQL injection vulnerability had been found in the quote_table_name\n    method that could allow malicious users to inject arbitrary SQL into a\n    query.\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the\n    strip_tags  helper. An parsing error can be exploited by an attacker,\n    who can confuse the parser and may inject HTML tags into the output\n    document.\nA newline (CRLF) injection vulnerability had been found in\n    response.rb. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary\n    HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via the\n    Content-Type header.\n"
