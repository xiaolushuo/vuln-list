    "Description": "The Curl_input_negotiate function in http_negotiate.c in libcurl 7.10.6 through 7.21.6, as used in curl and other products, always performs credential delegation during GSSAPI authentication, which allows remote servers to impersonate clients via GSSAPI requests.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2271\nRichard Silverman discovered that when doing GSSAPI authentication, libcurl\nunconditionally performs credential delegation. This hands the server a copy of\nthe client's security credentials, allowing the server to impersonate the\nclient to any other using the same GSSAPI mechanism.\nThis is obviously a very sensitive operation, which should only be done when\nthe user explicitly so directs.\n"
