    "Description": "The vsf_filename_passes_filter function in ls.c in vsftpd before 2.3.3 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and process slot exhaustion) via crafted glob expressions in STAT commands in multiple FTP sessions, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2305\nTwo security issue have been discovered that affect vsftpd, a lightweight,\nefficient FTP server written for security.\nIt was discovered that Linux kernels \u0026lt; 2.6.35 are considerably slower in\n    releasing than in the creation of network namespaces.  As a result of this\n    and because vsftpd is using this feature as a security enhancement to\n    provide network isolation for connections, it is possible to cause denial\n    of service conditions due to excessive memory allocations by the kernel.\n    This is technically no vsftpd flaw, but a kernel issue.  However, this\n    feature has legitimate use cases and backporting the specific kernel patch\n    is too intrusive.  Additionally, a local attacker requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN\n    capability to abuse this functionality.  Therefore, as a fix, a kernel\n    version check has been added to vsftpd in order to disable this feature\n    for kernels \u0026lt; 2.6.35.\nMaksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that vsftpd is incorrectly handling\n    certain glob expressions in STAT commands.  This allows a remote authenticated\n    attacker to conduct denial of service attacks (excessive CPU and process\n    slot exhaustion) via crafted STAT commands.\n"
