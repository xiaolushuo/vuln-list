    "Description": "The web browser plug-in in IcedTea-Web 1.0.x before 1.0.6 and 1.1.x before 1.1.4 allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy (SOP) and execute arbitrary script or establish network connections to unintended hosts via an applet whose origin has the same second-level domain, but a different sub-domain than the targeted domain.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2420\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an\nimplementation of the Oracle Java platform.\nThe IcedTea browser plugin included in the openjdk-6 package\n\tdoes not properly enforce the Same Origin Policy on web content\n\tserved under a domain name which has a common suffix with the\n\trequired domain name.\nThe Java Sound component did not properly check for array\n\tboundaries.  A malicious input or an untrusted Java application\n\tor applet could use this flaw to cause Java Virtual Machine to\n\tcrash or disclose portion of its memory.\nThe OpenJDK embedded web server did not guard against an\n\texcessive number of a request parameters, leading to a denial\n\tof service vulnerability involving hash collisions.\nIt was discovered that Java2D did not properly check graphics\n\trendering objects before passing them to the native renderer.\n\tThis could lead to JVM crash or Java sandbox bypass.\nThe ZIP central directory parser used by java.util.zip.ZipFile\n\tentered an infinite recursion in native code when processing a\n\tcrafted ZIP file, leading to a denial of service.\nA flaw was found in the AWT KeyboardFocusManager class that\n\tcould allow untrusted Java applets to acquire keyboard focus\n\tand possibly steal sensitive information.\nThe java.util.TimeZone.setDefault() method lacked a security\n\tmanager invocation, allowing an untrusted Java application or\n\tapplet to set a new default time zone.\nThe Java serialization code leaked references to serialization\n\texceptions, possibly leaking critical objects to untrusted\n\tcode in Java applets and applications.\nIt was discovered that CORBA implementation in Java did not\n\tproperly protect repository identifiers (that can be obtained\n\tusing _ids() method) on certain Corba objects.  This could\n\thave been used to perform modification of the data that should\n\thave been immutable.\nThe AtomicReferenceArray class implementation did not properly\n\tcheck if the array is of an expected Object[] type.  A\n\tmalicious Java application or applet could use this flaw to\n\tcause Java Virtual Machine to crash or bypass Java sandbox\n\trestrictions.\n"
