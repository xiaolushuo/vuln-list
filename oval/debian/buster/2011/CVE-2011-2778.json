    "Description": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in Tor before 0.2.2.35 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code by (1) establishing a SOCKS connection to SocksPort or (2) leveraging a SOCKS proxy configuration.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2363\nIt was discovered that Tor, an online privacy tool, incorrectly computes\nbuffer sizes in certain cases involving SOCKS connections.  Malicious\nparties could use this to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially \nallowing execution of arbitrary code.\nIn Tor's default configuration this issue can only be triggered by\nclients that can connect to Tor's SOCKS port, which listens only on\nlocalhost by default.\nIn non-default configurations where Tor's SocksPort listens not only on\nlocalhost or where Tor was configured to use another SOCKS server for all of\nits outgoing connections, Tor is vulnerable to a larger set of malicious\nparties.\n"
