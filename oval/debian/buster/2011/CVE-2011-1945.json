    "Description": "The elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) subsystem in OpenSSL 1.0.0d and earlier, when the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used for the ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suite, does not properly implement curves over binary fields, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to determine private keys via a timing attack and a lattice calculation.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2309\nSeveral fraudulent SSL certificates have been found in the wild issued\nby the DigiNotar Certificate Authority, obtained through a security\ncompromise of said company. After further updates on this incident, it\nhas been determined that all of DigiNotar's signing certificates can no\nlonger be trusted.\nDebian, like other software distributors and vendors, has decided to\ndistrust all of DigiNotar's CAs. In this update, this is done in the\ncrypto library (a component of the OpenSSL toolkit) by marking such\ncertificates as revoked.\nAny application that uses said component should now reject certificates\nsigned by DigiNotar. Individual applications may allow users to override\nthe validation failure. However, making exceptions is highly\ndiscouraged and should be carefully verified.\nAdditionally, a vulnerability has been found in the ECDHE_ECDS cipher\nwhere timing attacks make it easier to determine private keys. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies it as\n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1945\"\u003eCVE-2011-1945\u003c/a\u003e.\n"
