    "Description": "Tor before 0.2.2.34, when configured as a client or bridge, sends a TLS certificate chain as part of an outgoing OR connection, which allows remote relays to bypass intended anonymity properties by reading this chain and then determining the set of entry guards that the client or bridge had selected.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2331\nIt has been discovered by \u003cq\u003efrosty_un\u003c/q\u003e that a design flaw in Tor, an online\nprivacy tool, allows malicious relay servers to learn certain information\nthat they should not be able to learn. Specifically, a relay that a user\nconnects to directly could learn which other relays that user is\nconnected to directly. In combination with other attacks, this issue\ncan lead to deanonymizing the user.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned \u003ca\nhref=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2768\"\u003e\\\nCVE-2011-2768\u003c/a\u003e to this issue.\nIn addition to fixing the above mentioned issues, the updates to oldstable\nand stable fix a number of less critical issues (\u003ca\nhref=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2769\"\u003e\\\nCVE-2011-2769\u003c/a\u003e). Please\nsee the \u003ca\nhref=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02234-released-security-patches\"\u003e\\\nposting from the Tor blog\u003c/a\u003e for more information.\n\n"
