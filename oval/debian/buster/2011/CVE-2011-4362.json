    "Description": "Integer signedness error in the base64_decode function in the HTTP authentication functionality (http_auth.c) in lighttpd 1.4 before 1.4.30 and 1.5 before SVN revision 2806 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via crafted base64 input that triggers an out-of-bounds read with a negative index.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2368\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd, a small and fast\nwebserver with minimal memory footprint.\nXi Wang discovered that the base64 decoding routine which is used to\n  decode user input during an HTTP authentication, suffers of a signedness\n  issue when processing user input.  As a result it is possible to force\n  lighttpd to perform an out-of-bounds read which results in Denial of\n  Service conditions.\nWhen using CBC ciphers on an SSL enabled virtual host to communicate with\n  certain client, a so called \u003cq\u003eBEAST\u003c/q\u003e attack allows man-in-the-middle\n  attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP traffic via a blockwise\n  chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session.  Technically this is\n  no lighttpd vulnerability.  However, lighttpd offers a workaround to\n  mitigate this problem by providing a possibility to disable CBC ciphers.\nThis updates includes this option by default. System administrators\n  are advised to read the NEWS file of this update (as this may break older\n  clients).\n"
