    "Description": "The configuration merger in itk.c in the Steinar H. Gunderson mpm-itk Multi-Processing Module 2.2.11-01 and 2.2.11-02 for the Apache HTTP Server does not properly handle certain configuration sections that specify NiceValue but not AssignUserID, which might allow remote attackers to gain privileges by leveraging the root uid and root gid of an mpm-itk process.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2202\nMPM_ITK is an alternative Multi-Processing Module for Apache HTTPD that\nis included in Debian's apache2 package.\nA configuration parsing flaw has been found in MPM_ITK. If the\nconfiguration directive NiceValue was set, but no AssignUserID directive\nwas specified, the requests would be processed as user and group root\ninstead of the default Apache user and group.\nThis issue does not affect the standard Apache HTTPD MPMs prefork,\nworker, and event.\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.\n"
