      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2311\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an\nimplementation of the Java SE platform.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nInteger overflow errors in the JPEG and font parser allow\n\tuntrusted code (including applets) to elevate its privileges.\nHotspot, the just-in-time compiler in OpenJDK, mishandled\n\tcertain byte code instructions, allowing untrusted code\n\t(including applets) to crash the virtual machine.\nA race condition in signed object deserialization could\n\tallow untrusted code to modify signed content, apparently\n\tleaving its signature intact.\nUntrusted code (including applets) could access information\n\tabout network interfaces which was not intended to be public.\n\t(Note that the interface MAC address is still available to\n\tuntrusted code.)\nA float-to-long conversion could overflow, allowing\n\tuntrusted code (including applets) to crash the virtual\n\tmachine.\nUntrusted code (including applets) could intercept HTTP\n\trequests by reconfiguring proxy settings through a SOAP\n\tconnection.\nUntrusted code (including applets) could elevate its\n\tprivileges through the Swing MediaTracker code.\nIn addition, this update removes support for the Zero/Shark and Cacao\nHotspot variants from the i386 and amd64 due to stability issues.\nThese Hotspot variants are included in the openjdk-6-jre-zero and\nicedtea-6-jre-cacao packages, and these packages must be removed\nduring this update.\n"
