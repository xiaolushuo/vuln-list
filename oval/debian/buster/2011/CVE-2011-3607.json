    "Description": "Integer overflow in the ap_pregsub function in server/util.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the mod_setenvif module is enabled, allows local users to gain privileges via a .htaccess file with a crafted SetEnvIf directive, in conjunction with a crafted HTTP request header, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2405\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:\nAn integer overflow in ap_pregsub() could allow local attackers to\n  execute arbitrary code at elevated privileges via crafted .htaccess\n  files.\nThe Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the request URI for\n  proxied requests. In certain reverse proxy configurations using the\n  ProxyPassMatch directive or using the RewriteRule directive with the\n  [P] flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy connect to an\n  arbitrary server. This could allow the attacker to access internal\n  servers that are not otherwise accessible from the outside.\nThe three CVE ids denote slightly different variants of the same\n  issue.\nNote that, even with this issue fixed, it is the responsibility of\n  the administrator to ensure that the regular expression replacement\n  pattern for the target URI does not allow a client to append arbitrary\n  strings to the host or port parts of the target URI. For example, the\n  configuration\nis still insecure and should be replaced by one of the following\n  configurations:\nAn apache2 child process could cause the parent process to crash\n  during shutdown. This is a violation of the privilege separation\n  between the apache2 processes and could potentially be used to worsen\n  the impact of other vulnerabilities.\nThe response message for error code 400 (bad request) could be used to\n  expose \u003cq\u003ehttpOnly\u003c/q\u003e cookies. This could allow a remote attacker using\n  cross site scripting to steal authentication cookies.\n"
