    "Description": "The vulnerable-passwords script in Best Practical Solutions RT 3.x before 3.8.12 and 4.x before 4.0.6 does not update the password-hash algorithm for disabled user accounts, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to determine cleartext passwords, and possibly use these passwords after accounts are re-enabled, via a brute-force attack on the database.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-0009.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2480\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Request Tracker, an issue \ntracking system:\nThe vulnerable-passwords scripts introduced for \n    \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0009\"\u003eCVE-2011-0009\u003c/a\u003e\n    failed to correct the password hashes of disabled users.\nSeveral cross-site scripting issues have been discovered.\nPassword hashes could be disclosed by privileged users.\nSeveral cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities have been\n    found. If this update breaks your setup, you can restore the old\n    behaviour by setting $RestrictReferrer to 0.\nThe code to support variable envelope return paths allowed the\n    execution of arbitrary code.\nDisabled groups were not fully accounted as disabled.\nSQL injection vulnerability, only exploitable by privileged \n    users.\nPlease note that if you run request-tracker3.8 under the Apache web server, \nyou must stop and start Apache manually.  The \u003cq\u003erestart\u003c/q\u003e mechanism is not \nrecommended, especially when using mod_perl.\n"
