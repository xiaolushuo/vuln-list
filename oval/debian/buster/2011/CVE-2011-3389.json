    "Description": "The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction with JavaScript code that uses (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API, (2) the Java URLConnection API, or (3) the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a \"BEAST\" attack.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2398\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer\nlibrary. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\nThis update enables OpenSSL workarounds against the \u003cq\u003eBEAST\u003c/q\u003e attack.\n   Additional information can be found in the \u003ca\n   href=\"http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124B.html\"\u003ecURL advisory\u003c/a\u003e\n   \nDan Fandrich discovered that cURL performs insufficient sanitising\n   when extracting the file path part of an URL.\nDSA-2356\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an\nimplementation of the Java platform:\nThe TLS implementation does not guard properly against certain\n\tchosen-plaintext attacks when block ciphers are used in CBC\n\tmode.\nThe CORBA implementation contains a deserialization\n\tvulnerability in the IIOP implementation, allowing untrusted\n\tJava code (such as applets) to elevate its privileges.\nThe Java scripting engine lacks necessary security manager\n\tchecks, allowing untrusted Java code (such as applets) to\n\televate its privileges.\nThe skip() method in java.io.InputStream uses a shared buffer,\n\tallowing untrusted Java code (such as applets) to access data\n\tthat is skipped by other code.\nThe java.awt.AWTKeyStroke class contains a flaw which allows\n\tuntrusted Java code (such as applets) to elevate its\n\tprivileges.\nThe Java2D C code contains an integer overflow which results\n\tin a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially allowing\n\tuntrusted Java code (such as applets) to elevate its\n\tprivileges.\nMalicous Java code can use up an excessive amount of UDP\n\tports, leading to a denial of service.\nJAX-WS enables stack traces for certain server responses by\n\tdefault, potentially leaking sensitive information.\nJAR files in pack200 format are not properly checked for\n\terrors, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution when\n\tunpacking crafted pack200 files.\nThe RMI Registry server lacks access restrictions on certain\n\tmethods, allowing a remote client to execute arbitary code.\nThe RMI Registry server fails to properly restrict privileges\n\tof untrusted Java code, allowing RMI clients to elevate their\n\tprivileges on the RMI Registry server.\nThe com.sun.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection class does not perform\n\tproper security manager checks in the setSSLSocketFactory()\n\tmethod, allowing untrusted Java code to bypass security policy\n\trestrictions.\n"
