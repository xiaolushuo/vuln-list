    "Description": "Django 1.1.x before 1.1.4 and 1.2.x before 1.2.5 does not properly validate HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via forged AJAX requests that leverage a \"combination of browser plugins and redirects,\" a related issue to CVE-2011-0447.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2163\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the Django web development\nframework:\nFor several reasons the internal CSRF protection was not used to\n    validate AJAX requests in the past. However, it was discovered that\n    this exception can be exploited with a combination of browser plugins\n    and redirects and thus is not sufficient.\nIt was discovered that the file upload form is prone to cross-site\n    scripting attacks via the file name.\nIt is important to note that this update introduces minor backward\nincompatibilities due to the fixes for the above issues.\nFor the exact details, please see: \u003curl http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/releases/1.2.5/\u003e\nand in particular the \u003cq\u003eBackwards incompatible changes\u003c/q\u003e section.\nPackages in the oldstable distribution (lenny) are not affected by these\nproblems.\n"
