    "Description": "Clam AntiVirus ClamAV before 0.90 does not close open file descriptors under certain conditions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (file descriptor consumption and failed scans) via CAB archives with a cabinet header record length of zero, which causes a function to return without closing a file descriptor.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1263\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Clam\nanti-virus toolkit, which may lead to denial of service. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nIt was discovered that malformed CAB archives may exhaust file\n    descriptors, which allows denial of service.\nIt was discovered that a directory traversal vulnerability in the MIME\n    header parser may lead to denial of service.\n"
