    "Description": "Balabit syslog-ng 2.0.x before 2.0.6 and 2.1.x before 2.1.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a message with a timestamp that does not contain a trailing space, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1464\n\nOriol Carreras discovered that syslog-ng, a next generation logging\ndaemon can be tricked into dereferencing a NULL pointer through\nmalformed timestamps, which can lead to denial of service and the\ndisguise of an subsequent attack, which would otherwise be logged.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.0.0-1etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.0.6-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your syslog-ng package.\n\n"
