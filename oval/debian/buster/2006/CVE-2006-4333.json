    "Description": "The SSCOP dissector in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) before 0.99.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via malformed packets that cause the Q.2391 dissector to use excessive memory.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1171\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Ethereal network\nscanner, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nIt was discovered that the Q.2391 dissector is vulnerable to denial\n    of service caused by memory exhaustion.\nIt was discovered that the FC-FCS, RSVP and ISIS-LSP dissectors are\n    vulnerable to denial of service caused by memory exhaustion.\nIt was discovered that the IrDA and SMB dissectors are vulnerable to\n    denial of service caused by memory corruption.\nIt was discovered that the SLIMP3 and AgentX dissectors are vulnerable\n    to code injection caused by buffer overflows.\nIt was discovered that the BER dissector is vulnerable to denial of\n    service caused by an infinite loop.\nIt was discovered that the NCP and RTnet dissectors are vulnerable to\n    denial of service caused by a null pointer dereference.\nIt was discovered that the X11 dissector is vulnerable to denial of service\n    caused by a division through zero.\nThis update also fixes a 64 bit-specific regression in the ASN.1 decoder, which\nwas introduced in a previous DSA.\n"
