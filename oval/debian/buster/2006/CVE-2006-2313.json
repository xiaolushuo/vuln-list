      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1087\nSeveral encoding problems have been discovered in PostgreSQL, a\npopular SQL database.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nAkio Ishida and Yasuo Ohgaki discovered a weakness in the handling\n    of invalidly-encoded multibyte text data which could allow an\n    attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.\nA similar problem exists in client-side encodings (such as SJIS,\n    BIG5, GBK, GB18030, and UHC) which contain valid multibyte\n    characters that end with the backslash character.  An attacker\n    could supply a specially crafted byte sequence that is able to\n    inject arbitrary SQL commands.\nThis issue does not affect you if you only use single-byte (like\n    SQL_ASCII or the ISO-8859-X family) or unaffected multibyte (like\n    UTF-8) encodings.\npsycopg and python-pgsql use the old encoding for binary data and\n    may have to be updated.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is affected by these problems but\nwe're unable to correct the package.\n"
