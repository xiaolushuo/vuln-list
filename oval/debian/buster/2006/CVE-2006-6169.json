    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the ask_outfile_name function in openfile.c for GnuPG (gpg) 1.4 and 2.0, when running interactively, might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via messages with \"C-escape\" expansions, which cause the make_printable_string function to return a longer string than expected while constructing a prompt.",
