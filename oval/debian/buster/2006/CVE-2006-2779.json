    "Description": "Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird before 1.5.0.4 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) nested \u003coption\u003e tags in a select tag, (2) a DOMNodeRemoved mutation event, (3) \"Content-implemented tree views,\" (4) BoxObjects, (5) the XBL implementation, (6) an iframe that attempts to remove itself, which leads to memory corruption.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1159\nThe latest security updates of Mozilla Thunderbird introduced a\nregression that led to a dysfunctional attachment panel which warrants\na correction to fix this issue.  For reference please find below the\noriginal advisory text:\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and\nderived products such as Mozilla Thunderbird.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nvulnerabilities:\nMozilla team members discovered several crashes during testing of\n    the browser engine showing evidence of memory corruption which may\n    also lead to the execution of arbitrary code.  The last bit of\n    this problem will be corrected with the next update.  You can\n    prevent any trouble by disabling Javascript.  [MFSA-2006-32]\nThe Javascript engine might allow remote attackers to execute\n    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-50]\nMultiple integer overflows in the Javascript engine might allow\n    remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-50]\nSpecially crafted Javascript allows remote attackers to execute\n    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-51]\nRemote Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) servers could execute code with elevated\n    privileges via a specially crafted PAC script.  [MFSA-2006-52]\nScripts with the UniversalBrowserRead privilege could gain\n    UniversalXPConnect privileges and possibly execute code or obtain\n    sensitive data.  [MFSA-2006-53]\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability allows remote attackers to\n    inject arbitrary web script or HTML.  [MFSA-2006-54]\n"
