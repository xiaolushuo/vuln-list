    "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the tiffsplit command in libtiff 3.8.2 and earlier might might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: tiffsplit is not setuid.  If there is not a common scenario under which tiffsplit is called with attacker-controlled command line arguments, then perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1091\nSeveral problems have been discovered in the TIFF library.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:\nSuSE discovered a buffer overflow in the conversion of TIFF files\n    into PDF documents which could be exploited when tiff2pdf is used\n    e.g. in a printer filter.\nThe tiffsplit command from the TIFF library contains a buffer\n    overflow in the commandline handling which could be exploited when\n    the program is executed automatically on unknown filenames.\n"
