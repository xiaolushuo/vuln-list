    "Description": "The default configuration of the apache2 package in Debian GNU/Linux squeeze before 2.2.16-6+squeeze7, wheezy before 2.2.22-4, and sid before 2.2.22-4, when mod_php or mod_rivet is used, provides example scripts under the doc/ URI, which might allow local users to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, gain privileges, or obtain sensitive information via vectors involving localhost HTTP requests to the Apache HTTP Server.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2452\nNiels Heinen noticed a security issue with the default Apache\nconfiguration on Debian if certain scripting modules like mod_php or\nmod_rivet are installed. The problem arises because the directory\n/usr/share/doc, which is mapped to the URL /doc, may contain example\nscripts that can be executed by requests to this URL. Although access\nto the URL /doc is restricted to connections from localhost, this still\ncreates security issues in two specific configurations:\nSystems not meeting one of these two conditions are not known to be\nvulnerable. The actual security impact depends on which packages (and\naccordingly which example scripts) are installed on the system.\nPossible issues include cross site scripting, code execution, or\nleakage of sensitive data.\nThis updates removes the problematic configuration sections from the\nfiles /etc/apache2/sites-available/default and .../default-ssl. When\nupgrading, you should not blindly allow dpkg to replace those files,\nthough. Rather you should merge the changes, namely the removal of the\n\u003cq\u003eAlias /doc \"/usr/share/doc\"\u003c/q\u003e line and the related \u003cq\u003e\u0026lt;Directory\n\"/usr/share/doc/\"\u0026gt;\u003c/q\u003e block, into your versions of these config files.\nYou may also want to check if you have copied these sections to any\nadditional virtual host configurations.\n"
