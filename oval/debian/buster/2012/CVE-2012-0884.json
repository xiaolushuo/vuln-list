    "Description": "The implementation of Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and PKCS #7 in OpenSSL before 0.9.8u and 1.x before 1.0.0h does not properly restrict certain oracle behavior, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to decrypt data via a Million Message Attack (MMA) adaptive chosen ciphertext attack.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2454\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:\nIvan Nestlerode discovered a weakness in the CMS and PKCS #7\n\timplementations that could allow an attacker to decrypt data\n\tvia a Million Message Attack (MMA).\nIt was discovered that a NULL pointer could be dereferenced\n\twhen parsing certain S/MIME messages, leading to denial of\n\tservice.\nTavis Ormandy, Google Security Team, discovered a vulnerability\n\tin the way DER-encoded ASN.1 data is parsed that can result in\n\ta heap overflow.\nAdditionally, the fix for \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4619\"\u003eCVE-2011-4619\u003c/a\u003e has been updated to address an\nissue with SGC handshakes.\n\nTomas Hoger, Red Hat, discovered that the fix for\n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2110\"\u003eCVE-2012-2110\u003c/a\u003e\nfor the 0.9.8 series of OpenSSL was incomplete. It has been assigned the\n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2131\"\u003eCVE-2012-2131\u003c/a\u003e\nidentifier.\n\n"
