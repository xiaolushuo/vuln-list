      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2493\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Asterisk, a PBX and\ntelephony toolkit.\nThe IAX2 channel driver allows remote attackers to cause a\n\tdenial of service (daemon crash) by placing a call on hold\n\t(when a certain mohinterpret setting is enabled).\nThe Skinny channel driver allows remote authenticated users to\n\tcause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon\n\tcrash) by closing a connection in off-hook mode.\nIn addition, it was discovered that Asterisk does not set the\nalwaysauthreject option by default in the SIP channel driver.  This\nallows remote attackers to observe a difference in response behavior\nand check for the presence of account names.  (\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2666\"\u003eCVE-2011-2666\u003c/a\u003e)  System\nadministrators concerned by this user enumerating vulnerability should\nenable the alwaysauthreject option in the configuration.  We do not\nplan to change the default setting in the stable version\n(Asterisk 1.6) in order to preserve backwards compatibility.\n"
