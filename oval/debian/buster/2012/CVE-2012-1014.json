    "Description": "The process_as_req function in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.10.x before 1.10.3 does not initialize a certain structure member, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed AS-REQ request.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2518\nEmmanuel Bouillon from NCI Agency discovered multiple vulnerabilities in MIT\nKerberos, a daemon implementing the network authentication protocol.\nBy sending specially crafted AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request) to a KDC\n\t(Key Distribution Center), an attacker could make it free an uninitialized\n\tpointer, corrupting the heap.  This can lead to process crash or even arbitrary\n\tcode execution.\nThis CVE only affects testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions.\nBy sending specially crafted AS-REQ to a KDC, an attacker could make it\n\tdereference an uninitialized pointer, leading to process crash or even\n\tarbitrary code execution\nIn both cases, arbitrary code execution is believed to be difficult to achieve,\nbut might not be impossible.\n"
