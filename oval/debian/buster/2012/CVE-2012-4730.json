      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2567\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Request Tracker (RT), an issue\ntracking system.\nAuthenticated users can add arbitrary headers or content to\n\tmail generated by RT.\t\nA CSRF vulnerability may allow attackers to toggle ticket\n\tbookmarks.\nIf users follow a crafted URI and log in to RT, they may\n\ttrigger actions which would ordinarily blocked by the CSRF\n\tprevention logic.\nSeveral different vulnerabilities in GnuPG processing allow\n\tattackers to cause RT to improperly sign outgoing email.\nIf GnuPG support is enabled, authenticated users can\n\tcreate arbitrary files as the web server user, which may\n\tenable arbitrary code execution.\nPlease note that if you run request-tracker3.8 under the Apache web\n\tserver, you must stop and start Apache manually.  The \u003cq\u003erestart\u003c/q\u003e\n\tmechanism is not recommended, especially when using mod_perl.\n"
