    "Description": "The handle_mmio function in arch/x86/hvm/io.c in the MMIO operations emulator for Xen 3.3 and 4.x, when running an HVM guest, does not properly reset certain state information between emulation cycles, which allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via unspecified operations on MMIO regions.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2531\nSeveral denial-of-service vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen,\nthe popular virtualization software. The Common Vulnerabilities and \nExposures project identifies the following issues:\nGuest mode unprivileged code, which has been granted the privilege to \n access MMIO regions, may leverage that access to crash the whole guest.\n Since this can be used to crash a client from within, this vulnerability is\n considered to have low impact.\nA guest kernel can cause the host to become unresponsive for a period\n of time, potentially leading to a DoS. Since an attacker with full\n control in the guest can impact the host, this vulnerability is\n considered to have high impact.\n"
