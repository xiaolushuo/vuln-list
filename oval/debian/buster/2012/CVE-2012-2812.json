    "Description": "The exif_entry_get_value function in exif-entry.c in the EXIF Tag Parsing Library (aka libexif) before 0.6.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted EXIF tags in an image.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2559\nSeveral vulnerabilities were found in libexif, a library used to parse EXIF\nmeta-data on camera files.\nA heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the exif_entry_get_value \n    function allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly \n    obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via an image \n    with crafted EXIF tags.\nA heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the exif_convert_utf16_to_utf8 \n    function allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly \n    obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via an image \n    with crafted EXIF tags.\nA buffer overflow in the exif_entry_format_value function allows remote \n    attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code \n    via an image with crafted EXIF tags.\nA heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the exif_data_load_data function \n    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly obtain \n    potentially sensitive information from process memory via an image with \n    crafted EXIF tags.\nA divide-by-zero error in the mnote_olympus_entry_get_value function \n    while formatting EXIF maker note tags allows remote attackers to cause a \n    denial of service via an image with crafted EXIF tags.\nAn off-by-one error in the exif_convert_utf16_to_utf8 function allows \n    remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute \n    arbitrary code via an image with crafted EXIF tags.\nAn integer underflow in the exif_entry_get_value function can cause a \n    heap overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution while formatting an \n    EXIF tag, if the function is called with a buffer size parameter equal to \n    zero or one.\n"
