      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2475\nIt was discovered that openssl did not correctly handle explicit\nInitialization Vectors for CBC encryption modes, as used in TLS 1.1,\n1.2, and DTLS. An incorrect calculation would lead to an integer\nunderflow and incorrect memory access, causing denial of service\n(application crash.)\n"
