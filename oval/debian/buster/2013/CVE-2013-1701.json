      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2746\nMultiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of \nthe Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client. Multiple memory safety \nerrors, missing permission checks and other implementation errors may \nlead to the execution of arbitrary code or cross-site scripting.\nThe Icedove version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no longer \nsupported with full security updates. However, it should be noted that \nalmost all security issues in Icedove stem from the included browser engine.\nThese security problems only affect Icedove if scripting and HTML mails \nare enabled. If there are security issues specific to Icedove (e.g. a \nhypothetical buffer overflow in the IMAP implementation) we'll make an \neffort to backport such fixes to oldstable.\nDSA-2735\nMultiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version \nof the Mozilla Firefox web browser: multiple memory safety errors, \nmissing permission checks and other implementation errors may lead to \nthe execution of arbitrary code, cross-site scripting, privilege \nescalation, bypass of the same-origin policy or the installation of \nmalicious addons.\nThe Iceweasel version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no \nlonger supported with security updates.\n"
