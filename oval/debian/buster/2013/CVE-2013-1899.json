      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2658\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in PostgreSQL database server.\nMitsumasa Kondo and Kyotaro Horiguchi of NTT Open Source Software Center\n    discovered that it was possible for a connection request containing a\n    database name that begins with \u003cq\u003e-\u003c/q\u003e to be crafted that can damage or\n    destroy files within a server's data directory. Anyone with access to the\n    port the PostgreSQL server listens on can initiate this request.\nRandom numbers generated by contrib/pgcrypto functions may be easy for\n    another database user to guess.\nAn unprivileged user could run commands that could interfere with\n    in-progress backups.\n"
