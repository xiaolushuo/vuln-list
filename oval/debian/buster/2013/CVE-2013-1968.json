      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2703\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Subversion, a version control\nsystem. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\nSubversion repositories with the FSFS repository data store format\n    can be corrupted by newline characters in filenames. A remote\n    attacker with a malicious client could use this flaw to disrupt the\n    service for other users using that repository.\nSubversion's svnserve server process may exit when an incoming TCP\n    connection is closed early in the connection process. A remote\n    attacker can cause svnserve to exit and thus deny service to users\n    of the server.\n"
