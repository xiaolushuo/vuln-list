      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2897\nMultiple security issues were found in the Tomcat servlet and JSP engine:\nFORM authentication associates the most recent request requiring \n    authentication with the current session. By repeatedly sending a request \n    for an authenticated resource while the victim is completing the login \n    form, an attacker could inject a request that would be executed using the \n    victim's credentials.\nA runtime exception in AsyncListener.onComplete() prevents the request from \n    being recycled. This may expose elements of a previous request to a current \n    request.\nReject requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length \n    header when chunked encoding is being used.\nWhen processing a request submitted using the chunked transfer encoding, \n    Tomcat ignored but did not limit any extensions that were included. This allows \n    a client to perform a limited denial of service by streaming an unlimited amount \n    of data to the server.\nMultipart requests with a malformed Content-Type header could trigger an \n    infinite loop causing a denial of service.\n"
