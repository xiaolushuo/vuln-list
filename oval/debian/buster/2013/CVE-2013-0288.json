    "Description": "nss-pam-ldapd before 0.7.18 and 0.8.x before 0.8.11 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by performing a name lookup on an application with a large number of open file descriptors, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow related to incorrect use of the FD_SET macro.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2628\nGarth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the\nuse of FD_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd, which provides NSS and PAM modules for\nusing LDAP as a naming service, can lead to a stack-based buffer\noverflow. An attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to\ncause a process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or\npotentially execute arbitrary code.\n"
