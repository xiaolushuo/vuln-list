    "Description": "An ACL bypass flaw was found in pacemaker. An attacker having a local account on the cluster and in the haclient group could use IPC communication with various daemons directly to perform certain tasks that they would be prevented by ACLs from doing if they went through the configuration.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4791\nKen Gaillot discovered a vulnerability in the Pacemaker cluster\nresource manager: If ACLs were configured for users in the \u003cq\u003ehaclient\u003c/q\u003e\ngroup, the ACL restrictions could be bypassed via unrestricted IPC\ncommunication, resulting in cluster-wide arbitrary code execution with\nroot privileges.\nIf the \u003cq\u003eenable-acl\u003c/q\u003e cluster option isn't enabled, members of the\n\u003cq\u003ehaclient\u003c/q\u003e group can modify Pacemaker's Cluster Information Base without\nrestriction, which already gives them these capabilities, so there is\nno additional exposure in such a setup.\n"
