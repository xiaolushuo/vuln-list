    "Description": "In ZeroMQ before version 4.3.3, there is a denial-of-service vulnerability. Users with TCP transport public endpoints, even with CURVE/ZAP enabled, are impacted. If a raw TCP socket is opened and connected to an endpoint that is fully configured with CURVE/ZAP, legitimate clients will not be able to exchange any message. Handshakes complete successfully, and messages are delivered to the library, but the server application never receives them. This is patched in version 4.3.3.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4761\nIt was discovered that ZeroMQ, a lightweight messaging kernel library\ndoes not properly handle connecting peers before a handshake is\ncompleted. A remote, unauthenticated client connecting to an application\nusing the libzmq library, running with a socket listening with CURVE\nencryption/authentication enabled can take advantage of this flaw to\ncause a denial of service affecting authenticated and encrypted clients.\n"
