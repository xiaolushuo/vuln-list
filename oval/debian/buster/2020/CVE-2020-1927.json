      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4757\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.\nFabrice Perez reported that certain mod_rewrite configurations are\n    prone to an open redirect.\nChamal De Silva discovered that the mod_proxy_ftp module uses\n    uninitialized memory when proxying to a malicious FTP backend.\nFelix Wilhelm discovered that a specially crafted value for the\n    'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request could cause a crash when\n    the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards.\nFelix Wilhelm reported a buffer overflow flaw in the mod_proxy_uwsgi\n    module which could result in information disclosure or potentially\n    remote code execution.\nFelix Wilhelm reported that when trace/debug was enabled for the\n    HTTP/2 module certain traffic edge patterns can cause logging\n    statements on the wrong connection, causing concurrent use of\n    memory pools.\n"
