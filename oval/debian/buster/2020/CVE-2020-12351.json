      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4774\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,\ndenial of service or information leaks.\nAndy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation in the\n    way L2CAP packets with A2MP CID are handled. A remote attacker in\n    short distance knowing the victim's Bluetooth device address can\n    send a malicious l2cap packet and cause a denial of service or\n    possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.\nAndy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation. Stack\n    memory is not properly initialised when handling certain AMP\n    packets. A remote attacker in short distance knowing the victim's\n    Bluetooth device address can retrieve kernel stack information.\nA flaw was discovered in netfilter subsystem. A local attacker\n    able to inject conntrack Netlink configuration can cause a denial\n    of service.\nChenNan Of Chaitin Security Research Lab discovered a flaw in the\n    hdlc_ppp module. Improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr()\n    function may lead to memory corruption and information disclosure.\nA flaw was discovered in the interface driver for GENEVE\n    encapsulated traffic when combined with IPsec. If IPsec is\n    configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the\n    GENEVE tunnel, tunneled data isn't correctly routed over the\n    encrypted link and sent unencrypted instead.\n"
