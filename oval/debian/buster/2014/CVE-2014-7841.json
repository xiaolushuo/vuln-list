    "Description": "The sctp_process_param function in net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c in the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.17.4, when ASCONF is used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a malformed INIT chunk.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3093\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation:\nLiu Wei of Red Hat discovered that a SCTP server doing ASCONF will\n    panic on malformed INIT chunks by triggering a NULL pointer\n    dereference.\nA flaw was discovered in the way iommu mapping failures were handled\n    in the kvm_iommu_map_pages() function in the Linux kernel. A guest\n    OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host\n    OS memory corruption) or possibly have other unspecified impact on\n    the host OS.\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the\n    TechnoTrend/Hauppauge DEC USB driver. A local user with write access\n    to the corresponding device could use this flaw to crash the kernel\n    or, potentially, elevate their privileges.\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that the do_double_fault function in\n    arch/x86/kernel/traps.c in the Linux kernel did not properly handle\n    faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) segment register,\n    which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic).\n"
