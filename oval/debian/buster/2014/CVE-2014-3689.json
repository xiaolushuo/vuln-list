      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3066\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor\nemulator.\nThe Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security reported that\n    guest provided parameter were insufficiently validated in\n    rectangle functions in the vmware-vga driver. A privileged guest\n    user could use this flaw to write into qemu address space on the\n    host, potentially escalating their privileges to those of the\n    qemu host process.\nJames Spadaro of Cisco reported insufficiently sanitized\n    bits_per_pixel from the client in the QEMU VNC display driver. An\n    attacker having access to the guest's VNC console could use this\n    flaw to crash the guest.\n"
