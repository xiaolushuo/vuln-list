    "Description": "parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.2 does not properly prevent entity expansion even when entity substitution has been disabled, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity references, a variant of the \"billion laughs\" attack.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3057\nSogeti found a denial of service flaw in libxml2, a library providing\nsupport to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker\ncould provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed by an\napplication using libxml2, would lead to excessive CPU consumption\n(denial of service) based on excessive entity substitutions, even if\nentity substitution was disabled, which is the parser default behavior.\n(\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3660\"\u003eCVE-2014-3660\u003c/a\u003e)\nIn addition, this update addresses a misapplied chunk for a patch\nreleased in version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy1 (#762864), and a memory leak\nregression (#765770) introduced in version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+nmu3.\n"
