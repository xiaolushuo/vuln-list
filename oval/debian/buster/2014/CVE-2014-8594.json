    "Description": "The do_mmu_update function in arch/x86/mm.c in Xen 4.x through 4.4.x does not properly restrict updates to only PV page tables, which allows remote PV guests to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by leveraging hardware emulation services for HVM guests using Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP).",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3140\nMultiple security issues have been discovered in the Xen virtualisation\nsolution which may result in denial of service, information disclosure\nor privilege escalation.\nRoger Pau Monne and Jan Beulich discovered that incomplete\n    restrictions on MMU update hypercalls may result in privilege\n    escalation.\nJan Beulich discovered that missing privilege level checks in the\n    x86 emulation of far branches may result in privilege escalation.\nJan Beulich discovered that an error in compatibility mode hypercall\n    argument translation may result in denial of service.\nJan Beulich discovered that an insufficient restriction in\n    acceleration support for the \u003cq\u003eREP MOVS\u003c/q\u003e instruction may result in\n    denial of service.\nAndrew Cooper discovered a page reference leak in MMU_MACHPHYS_UPDATE\n    handling, resulting in denial of service.\n"
