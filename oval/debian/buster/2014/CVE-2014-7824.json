    "Description": "D-Bus 1.3.0 through 1.6.x before 1.6.26, 1.8.x before 1.8.10, and 1.9.x before 1.9.2 allows local users to cause a denial of service (prevention of new connections and connection drop) by queuing the maximum number of file descriptors.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-3636.1.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3099\nSimon McVittie discovered that the fix for \n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3636\"\u003e\\\nCVE-2014-3636\u003c/a\u003e was incorrect, as it did not fully address the underlying\ndenial-of-service vector.  This update starts the D-Bus daemon as root\ninitially, so that it can properly raise its file descriptor count.\nIn addition, this update reverts the auth_timeout change in the\nprevious security update to its old value because the new value causes\nboot failures on some systems.  See the README.Debian file for details\nhow to harden the D-Bus daemon against malicious local users.\n"
