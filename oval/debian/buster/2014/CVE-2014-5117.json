    "Description": "Tor before 0.2.4.23 and 0.2.5 before 0.2.5.6-alpha maintains a circuit after an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell is received by a client, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct traffic-confirmation attacks by using the pattern of RELAY and RELAY_EARLY cells as a means of communicating information about hidden service names.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2993\nSeveral issues have been discovered in Tor, a connection-based\nlow-latency anonymous communication system, resulting in information\nleaks.\nRelay-early cells could be used by colluding relays on the network to\n   tag user circuits and so deploy traffic confirmation attacks\n   [\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5117\"\u003eCVE-2014-5117\u003c/a\u003e].  The updated version emits a warning and drops the\n   circuit upon receiving inbound relay-early cells, preventing this\n   specific kind of attack.  Please consult the following advisory for\n   more details about this issue:\n\u003ca href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack\"\u003e\\\n   https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack\u003c/a\u003e\nA bug in the bounds-checking in the 32-bit curve25519-donna\n   implementation could cause incorrect results on 32-bit\n   implementations when certain malformed inputs were used along with a\n   small class of private ntor keys.  This flaw does not currently\n   appear to allow an attacker to learn private keys or impersonate a\n   Tor server, but it could provide a means to distinguish 32-bit Tor\n   implementations from 64-bit Tor implementations.\nThe following additional security-related improvements have been\nimplemented:\nAs a client, the new version will effectively stop using CREATE_FAST\n   cells.  While this adds computational load on the network, this\n   approach can improve security on connections where Tor's circuit\n   handshake is stronger than the available TLS connection security\n   levels.\nPrepare clients to use fewer entry guards by honoring the consensus\n   parameters.  The following article provides some background:\n\u003ca href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters\"\u003e\\\n   https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters\u003c/a\u003e\n"
