    "Description": "The deflate_in_filter function in mod_deflate.c in the mod_deflate module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.10, when request body decompression is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via crafted request data that decompresses to a much larger size.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2989\nSeveral security issues were found in the Apache HTTP server.\nThe DEFLATE input filter (inflates request bodies) in mod_deflate\n    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource\n    consumption) via crafted request data that decompresses to a much\n    larger size.\nA race condition was found in mod_status. An attacker able to\n    access a public server status page on a server could send carefully\n    crafted requests which could lead to a heap buffer overflow,\n    causing denial of service, disclosure of sensitive information, or\n    potentially the execution of arbitrary code.\nA flaw was found in mod_cgid. If a server using mod_cgid hosted\n    CGI scripts which did not consume standard input, a remote attacker\n    could cause child processes to hang indefinitely, leading to denial\n    of service.\n"
