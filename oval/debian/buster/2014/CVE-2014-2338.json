    "Description": "IKEv2 in strongSwan 4.0.7 before 5.1.3 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by rekeying an IKE_SA during (1) initiation or (2) re-authentication, which triggers the IKE_SA state to be set to established.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2903\nAn authentication bypass vulnerability was found in charon, the daemon\nhandling IKEv2 in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite. The state machine\nhandling the security association (IKE_SA) handled some state transitions\nincorrectly.\nAn attacker can trigger the vulnerability by rekeying an unestablished\nIKE_SA during the initiation itself. This will trick the IKE_SA state to\n\u003cq\u003eestablished\u003c/q\u003e without the need to provide any valid credential.\nVulnerable setups include those actively initiating IKEv2 IKE_SA (like\nâclientsâ or âroadwarriorsâ) but also during re-authentication (which\ncan be initiated by the responder). Installations using IKEv1 (pluto\ndaemon in strongSwan 4 and earlier, and IKEv1 code in charon 5.x) is not\naffected.\n"
