    "Description": "The ssl23_get_client_hello function in s23_srvr.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8zc, 1.0.0o, and 1.0.1j does not properly handle attempts to use unsupported protocols, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an unexpected handshake, as demonstrated by an SSLv3 handshake to a no-ssl3 application with certain error handling.  NOTE: this issue became relevant after the CVE-2014-3568 fix.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3125\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure\nSockets Layer toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following issues:\nFrank Schmirler reported that the ssl23_get_client_hello function in\n    OpenSSL does not properly handle attempts to use unsupported\n    protocols. When OpenSSL is built with the no-ssl3 option and a SSL\n    v3 ClientHello is received, the ssl method would be set to NULL which\n    could later result in a NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash.\nPieter Wuille of Blockstream reported that the bignum squaring\n    (BN_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms, which\n    might make it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic\n    protection mechanisms.\nMarkus Stenberg of Cisco Systems, Inc. reported that a carefully\n    crafted DTLS message can cause a segmentation fault in OpenSSL due\n    to a NULL pointer dereference. A remote attacker could use this flaw\n    to mount a denial of service attack.\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that an\n    OpenSSL client would accept a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH\n    ciphersuite if the server key exchange message is omitted. This\n    allows remote SSL servers to conduct ECDHE-to-ECDH downgrade attacks\n    and trigger a loss of forward secrecy.\nAntti Karjalainen and Tuomo Untinen of the Codenomicon CROSS project\n    and Konrad Kraszewski of Google reported various certificate\n    fingerprint issues, which allow remote attackers to defeat a\n    fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist protection mechanism.\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that\n    an OpenSSL client will accept the use of an ephemeral RSA key in a\n    non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite, violating the TLS\n    standard. This allows remote SSL servers to downgrade the security\n    of the session.\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that an\n    OpenSSL server will accept a DH certificate for client\n    authentication without the certificate verify message. This flaw\n    effectively allows a client to authenticate without the use of a\n    private key via crafted TLS handshake protocol traffic to a server\n    that recognizes a certification authority with DH support.\nChris Mueller discovered a memory leak in the dtls1_buffer_record\n    function. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to mount a\n    denial of service through memory exhaustion by repeatedly sending\n    specially crafted DTLS records.\n"
