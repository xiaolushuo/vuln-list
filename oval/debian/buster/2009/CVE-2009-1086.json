    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the ldns_rr_new_frm_str_internal function in ldns 1.4.x allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a DNS resource record (RR) with a long (1) class field (clas variable) and possibly (2) TTL field.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1795\nStefan Kaltenbrunner discovered that ldns, a library and set of utilities\nto facilitate DNS programming, did not correctly implement a buffer\nboundary check in its RR DNS record parser.  This weakness could enable\noverflow of a heap buffer if a maliciously-crafted record is parsed,\npotentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.  The scope of\ncompromise will vary with the context in which ldns is used, and could\npresent either a local or remote attack vector.\nThe old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by this issue.\n"
