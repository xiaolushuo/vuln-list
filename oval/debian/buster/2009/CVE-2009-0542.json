    "Description": "SQL injection vulnerability in ProFTPD Server 1.3.1 through 1.3.2rc2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a \"%\" (percent) character in the username, which introduces a \"'\" (single quote) character during variable substitution by mod_sql.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1727\nTwo SQL injection vulnerabilities have been found in proftpd, a\nvirtual-hosting FTP daemon.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nShino discovered that proftpd is prone to an SQL injection\n    vulnerability via the use of certain characters in the username.\nTJ Saunders discovered that proftpd is prone to an SQL injection\n    vulnerability due to insufficient escaping mechanisms, when\n    multybite character encodings are used.\nDSA-1730\nThe security update for proftpd-dfsg in DSA-1727-1 caused a regression\nwith the postgresql backend. This update corrects the flaw. Also it was\ndiscovered that the oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by the\nsecurity issues. For reference the original advisory follows.\nTwo SQL injection vulnerabilities have been found in proftpd, a\nvirtual-hosting FTP daemon.
