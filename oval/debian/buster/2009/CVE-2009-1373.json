    "Description": "Buffer overflow in the XMPP SOCKS5 bytestream server in Pidgin (formerly Gaim) before 2.5.6 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving an outbound XMPP file transfer.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1805\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin, a graphical\nmulti-protocol instant messaging client. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\nA buffer overflow in the Jabber file transfer code may lead to\n    denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.\nMemory corruption in an internal library may lead to denial of\n    service.\nThe patch provided for the security issue tracked as \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2927\"\u003eCVE-2008-2927\u003c/a\u003e\n    - integer overflows in the MSN protocol handler - was found to be\n    incomplete.\nThe old stable distribution (etch) is affected under the source package\nname gaim. However, due to build problems the updated packages couldn't\nbe released along with the stable version. It will be released once the\nbuild problem is resolved.\n"
