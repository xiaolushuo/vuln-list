      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2563\nSeveral vulnerabilities were found in ViewVC, a web interface for CVS\nand Subversion repositories.\n\nRemote attackers can bypass the cvsdb row_limit\nconfiguration setting, and consequently conduct resource-consumption\nattacks via the limit parameter.\n\nThe remote Subversion views functionality does not properly\nperform authorization, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended\naccess restrictions.\n\nThe Subversion revision view does not properly handle log\nmessages when a readable path is copied from an unreadable path, which\nallows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information.\n\n\u003cq\u003efunction name\u003c/q\u003e lines returned by diff are not properly\nescaped, allowing attackers with commit access to perform cross site\nscripting.\n"
