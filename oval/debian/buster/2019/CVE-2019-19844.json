    "Description": "Django before 1.11.27, 2.x before 2.2.9, and 3.x before 3.0.1 allows account takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that is equal to an existing user's email address after case transformation of Unicode characters) would allow an attacker to be sent a password reset token for the matched user account. (One mitigation in the new releases is to send password reset tokens only to the registered user email address.)",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4598\nSimon Charette reported that the password reset functionality in Django,\na high-level Python web development framework, uses a Unicode\ncase-insensitive query to retrieve accounts matching the email address\nrequesting the password reset. An attacker can take advantage of this\nflaw to potentially retrieve password reset tokens and hijack accounts.\nFor details please refer to\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2019/dec/18/security-releases/\"\u003ehttps://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2019/dec/18/security-releases/\u003c/a\u003e\n"
