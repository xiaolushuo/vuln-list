    "Description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4503\nThree vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Go programming language;\n\"net/url\" accepted some invalid hosts in URLs which could result in\nauthorisation bypass in some applications and the HTTP/2 implementation\nwas susceptible to denial of service.\nDSA-4508\nThree vulnerabilities were discovered in the HTTP/2 code of the H2O HTTP\nserver, which could result in denial of service.\nDSA-4520\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the HTTP/2 code of Apache\nTraffic Server, a reverse and forward proxy server, which could result\nin denial of service.\nThe fixes are too intrusive to backport to the version in the oldstable\ndistribution (stretch). An upgrade to Debian stable (buster) is\nrecommended instead.\n"
