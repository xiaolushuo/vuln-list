    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4498\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in python-django, a web\ndevelopment framework. They could lead to remote denial-of-service or\nSQL injection,\n"
