    "Description": "A vulnerability was discovered in DNS resolver component of knot resolver through version 3.2.0 before 4.1.0 which allows remote attackers to bypass DNSSEC validation for non-existence answer. NXDOMAIN answer would get passed through to the client even if its DNSSEC validation failed, instead of sending a SERVFAIL packet. Caching is not affected by this particular bug but see CVE-2019-10191.",
