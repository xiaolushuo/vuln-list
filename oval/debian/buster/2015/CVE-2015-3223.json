    "Description": "The ldb_wildcard_compare function in ldb_match.c in ldb before 1.1.24, as used in the AD LDAP server in Samba 4.x before 4.1.22, 4.2.x before 4.2.7, and 4.3.x before 4.3.3, mishandles certain zero values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via crafted packets.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3433\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,\nprint, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following issues:\nThilo Uttendorfer of Linux Information Systems AG discovered that a\n    malicious request can cause the Samba LDAP server to hang, spinning\n    using CPU. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to\n    mount a denial of service.\nJan \u003cq\u003eYenya\u003c/q\u003e Kasprzak and the Computer Systems Unit team at Faculty\n    of Informatics, Masaryk University discovered that insufficient\n    symlink verification could allow data access outside an exported\n    share path.\nStefan Metzmacher of SerNet discovered that Samba does not ensure\n    that signing is negotiated when creating an encrypted client\n    connection to a server. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to\n    downgrade the connection and connect using the supplied credentials\n    as an unsigned, unencrypted connection.\nIt was discovered that a missing access control check in the VFS\n    shadow_copy2 module could allow unauthorized users to access\n    snapshots.\nDouglas Bagnall of Catalyst discovered that the Samba LDAP server\n    is vulnerable to a remote memory read attack. A remote attacker can\n    obtain sensitive information from daemon heap memory by sending\n    crafted packets and then either read an error message, or a\n    database value.\nIt was discovered that a malicious client can send packets that\n    cause the LDAP server provided by the AD DC in the samba daemon\n    process to consume unlimited memory and be terminated.\nAndrew Bartlett of the Samba Team and Catalyst discovered that a\n    Samba server deployed as an AD DC can expose Windows DCs in the same\n    domain to a denial of service via the creation of multiple machine\n    accounts. This issue is related to the MS15-096 / \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2535\"\u003eCVE-2015-2535\u003c/a\u003e\n    security issue in Windows.\n"
