      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3454\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VirtualBox, an x86\nvirtualisation solution.\nUpstream support for the 4.1 release series has ended and since no\ninformation is available which would allow backports of isolated security\nfixes, security support for virtualbox in wheezy/oldstable needed to be\nended as well.\nIf you use virtualbox with externally procured VMs (e.g. through vagrant)\nwe advise you to update to Debian jessie.\n"
