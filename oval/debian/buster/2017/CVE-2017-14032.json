    "Description": "ARM mbed TLS before 1.3.21 and 2.x before 2.1.9, if optional authentication is configured, allows remote attackers to bypass peer authentication via an X.509 certificate chain with many intermediates. NOTE: although mbed TLS was formerly known as PolarSSL, the releases shipped with the PolarSSL name are not affected.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3967\nAn authentication bypass vulnerability was discovered in mbed TLS, a\nlightweight crypto and SSL/TLS library, when the authentication mode is\nconfigured as \u003cq\u003eoptional\u003c/q\u003e. A remote attacker can take advantage of this\nflaw to mount a man-in-the-middle attack and impersonate an intended\npeer via an X.509 certificate chain with many intermediates.\n"
