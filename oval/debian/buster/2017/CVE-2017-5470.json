    "Description": "Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 54, Firefox ESR \u003c 52.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 52.2.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3881\nSeveral security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web\nbrowser: Multiple memory safety errors, use-after-frees, buffer overflows\nand other implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary\ncode, denial of service or domain spoofing.\nDebian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support\nfor the 45.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now\nfollowing the 52.x releases.\n"
