    "Description": "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine in Mozilla Firefox before 47.0 and Firefox ESR 45.x before 45.2 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3600\nMultiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web\nbrowser: Multiple memory safety errors, buffer overflows and other\nimplementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or\nspoofing.\nWait, Firefox? No more references to Iceweasel? That's right, Debian no\nlonger applies a custom branding. Please see these links for further\ninformation: \u003ca href=\"https://glandium.org/blog/?p=3622\"\u003ehttps://glandium.org/blog/?p=3622\u003c/a\u003e,\n\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_software_rebranded_by_Debian\"\u003e\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_software_rebranded_by_Debian\u003c/a\u003e\nDebian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support\nfor the 38.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now\nfollowing the 45.x releases and this update to the next ESR is also the\npoint where we reapply the original branding.\nTransition packages for the iceweasel packages are provided which\nautomatically upgrade to the new version. Since new binary packages need\nto be installed, make sure to allow that in your upgrade procedure (e.g.\nby using \u003cq\u003eapt-get dist-upgrade\u003c/q\u003e instead of \u003cq\u003eapt-get upgrade\u003c/q\u003e).\nDSA-3647\nMultiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of\nthe Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple memory safety errors may\nlead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.\n"
