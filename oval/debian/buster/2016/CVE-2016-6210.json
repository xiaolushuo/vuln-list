    "Description": "sshd in OpenSSH before 7.3, when SHA256 or SHA512 are used for user password hashing, uses BLOWFISH hashing on a static password when the username does not exist, which allows remote attackers to enumerate users by leveraging the timing difference between responses when a large password is provided.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3626\nEddie Harari reported that the OpenSSH SSH daemon allows user\nenumeration through timing differences when trying to authenticate\nusers. When sshd tries to authenticate a non-existing user, it will pick\nup a fixed fake password structure with a hash based on the Blowfish\nalgorithm. If real users passwords are hashed using SHA256/SHA512, then\na remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw by sending large\npasswords, receiving shorter response times from the server for\nnon-existing users.\n"
