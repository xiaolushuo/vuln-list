      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3625\nSeveral security issues have been discovered in the Squid caching proxy.\nCESG and Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that Squid cachemgr.cgi was\n    vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing remotely supplied\n    inputs relayed through Squid.\nCESG discovered that a buffer overflow made Squid vulnerable to a\n    Denial of Service (DoS) attack when processing ESI responses.\nCESG found that Squid was vulnerable to public information\n    disclosure of the server stack layout when processing ESI responses.\nCESG discovered that Squid was vulnerable to remote code execution\n    when processing ESI responses.\nJianjun Chen found that Squid was vulnerable to a header smuggling\n    attack that could lead to cache poisoning and to bypass of\n    same-origin security policy in Squid and some client browsers.\n\"bfek-18\" and \"@vftable\" found that Squid was vulnerable to a Denial\n    of Service (DoS) attack when processing ESI responses, due to\n    incorrect pointer handling and reference counting.\n"
