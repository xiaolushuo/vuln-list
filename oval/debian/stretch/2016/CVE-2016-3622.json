    "Description": "The fpAcc function in tif_predict.c in the tiff2rgba tool in LibTIFF 4.0.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error) via a crafted TIFF image.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3762\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the libtiff library\nand the included tools tiff2rgba, rgb2ycbcr, tiffcp, tiffcrop, tiff2pdf\nand tiffsplit, which may result in denial of service, memory disclosure\nor the execution of arbitrary code.\nThere were additional vulnerabilities in the tools bmp2tiff, gif2tiff,\nthumbnail and ras2tiff, but since these were addressed by the libtiff\ndevelopers by removing the tools altogether, no patches are available\nand those tools were also removed from the tiff package in Debian\nstable. The change had already been made in Debian stretch before and\nno applications included in Debian are known to rely on these scripts.\nIf you use those tools in custom setups, consider using a different\nconversion/thumbnailing tool.\n"
