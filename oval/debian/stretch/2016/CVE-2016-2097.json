    "Description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in Action View in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.22.2 and 4.x before 4.1.14.2 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files by leveraging an application's unrestricted use of the render method and providing a .. (dot dot) in a pathname.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-0752.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3509\nTwo vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, a web application\nframework written in Ruby. Both vulnerabilities affect Action Pack, which\nhandles the web requests for Rails.\nCrafted requests to Action View, one of the components of Action Pack,\n    might result in rendering files from arbitrary locations, including\n    files beyond the application's view directory. This vulnerability is\n    the result of an incomplete fix of \n    \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0752\"\u003eCVE-2016-0752\u003c/a\u003e.\n    This bug was found by Jyoti Singh and Tobias Kraze from Makandra.\nIf a web applications does not properly sanitize user inputs, an\n    attacker might control the arguments of the render method in a\n    controller or a view, resulting in the possibility of executing\n    arbitrary ruby code.\n    This bug was found by Tobias Kraze from Makandra and joernchen of\n    Phenoelit.\n"
