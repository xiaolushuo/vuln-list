    "Description": "In Mercurial before 4.1.3, \"hg serve --stdio\" allows remote authenticated users to launch the Python debugger, and consequently execute arbitrary code, by using --debugger as a repository name.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3963\nSeveral issues were discovered in Mercurial, a distributed revision\ncontrol system.\nJonathan Claudius of Mozilla discovered that repositories served\n  over stdio could be tricked into granting authorized users access to\n  the Python debugger.\nMercurial's symlink auditing was incomplete, and could be abused to\n  write files outside the repository.\nJoern Schneeweisz discovered that Mercurial did not correctly handle\n  maliciously constructed ssh:// URLs. This allowed an attacker to run\n  an arbitrary shell command.\n"
