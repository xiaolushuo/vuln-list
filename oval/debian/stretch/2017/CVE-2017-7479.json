      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3900\nSeveral issues were discovered in openvpn, a virtual private network\napplication.\nIt was discovered that openvpn did not properly handle the\n    rollover of packet identifiers. This would allow an authenticated\n    remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application\n    crash.\nGuido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle\n    specific malformed IPv6 packets. This would allow a remote\n    attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application crash.\nGuido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle\n    clients connecting to an HTTP proxy with NTLMv2\n    authentication. This would allow a remote attacker to cause a\n    denial-of-service via application crash, or potentially leak\n    sensitive information like the user's proxy password.\nGuido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle\n    some x509 extensions. This would allow a remote attacker to cause\n    a denial-of-service via application crash.\n"
