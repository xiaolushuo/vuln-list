    "Description": "During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer. This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer. This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 56, Firefox ESR \u003c 52.4, and Thunderbird \u003c 52.4.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3998\nMartin Thomson discovered that nss, the Mozilla Network Security Service\nlibrary, is prone to a use-after-free vulnerability in the TLS 1.2\nimplementation when handshake hashes are generated. A remote attacker\ncan take advantage of this flaw to cause an application using the nss\nlibrary to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially to\nexecute arbitrary code.\n"
