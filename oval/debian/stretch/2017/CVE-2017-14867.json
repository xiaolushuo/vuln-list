    "Description": "Git before 2.10.5, 2.11.x before 2.11.4, 2.12.x before 2.12.5, 2.13.x before 2.13.6, and 2.14.x before 2.14.2 uses unsafe Perl scripts to support subcommands such as cvsserver, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via shell metacharacters in a module name. The vulnerable code is reachable via git-shell even without CVS support.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3984\njoernchen discovered that the git-cvsserver subcommand of Git, a\ndistributed version control system, suffers from a shell command\ninjection vulnerability due to unsafe use of the Perl backtick\noperator.  The git-cvsserver subcommand is reachable from the\ngit-shell subcommand even if CVS support has not been configured\n(however, the git-cvs package needs to be installed).\nIn addition to fixing the actual bug, this update removes the\ncvsserver subcommand from git-shell by default.  Refer to the updated\ndocumentation for instructions how to reenable in case this CVS\nfunctionality is still needed.\n"
