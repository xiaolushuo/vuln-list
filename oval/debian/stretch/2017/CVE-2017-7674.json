    "Description": "The CORS Filter in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M21, 8.5.0 to 8.5.15, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.44 and 7.0.41 to 7.0.78 did not add an HTTP Vary header indicating that the response varies depending on Origin. This permitted client and server side cache poisoning in some circumstances.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3974\nTwo issues were discovered in the Tomcat servlet and JSP engine.\nRick Riemer discovered that the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\n    filter did not add a Vary header indicating possible different\n    responses, which could lead to cache poisoning.\nMarkus DĂśrschmidt found that the HTTP/2 implementation bypassed\n    some security checks, thus allowing an attacker to conduct\n    directory traversal attacks by using specially crafted URLs.\n"
