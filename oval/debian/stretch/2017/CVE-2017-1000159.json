      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4624\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in evince, a simple multi-page\ndocument viewer.\nTobias Mueller reported that the DVI exporter in evince is\n    susceptible to a command injection vulnerability via specially\n    crafted filenames.\nAndy Nguyen reported that the tiff_document_render() and\n    tiff_document_get_thumbnail() functions in the TIFF document backend\n    did not handle errors from TIFFReadRGBAImageOriented(), leading to\n    disclosure of uninitialized memory when processing TIFF image files.\nA buffer overflow vulnerability in the tiff backend could lead to\n    denial of service, or potentially the execution of arbitrary code if\n    a specially crafted PDF file is opened.\n"
