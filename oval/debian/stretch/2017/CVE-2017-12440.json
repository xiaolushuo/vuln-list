    "Description": "Aodh as packaged in Openstack Ocata and Newton before change-ID I8fd11a7f9fe3c0ea5f9843a89686ac06713b7851 and before Pike-rc1 does not verify that trust IDs belong to the user when creating alarm action with the scheme trust+http, which allows remote authenticated users with knowledge of trust IDs where Aodh is the trustee to obtain a Keystone token and perform unspecified authenticated actions by adding an alarm action with the scheme trust+http, and providing a trust id where Aodh is the trustee.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3953\nZane Bitter from Red Hat discovered a vulnerability in Aodh, the alarm\nengine for OpenStack. Aodh does not verify that the user creating the\nalarm is the trustor or has the same rights as the trustor, nor that the\ntrust is for the same project as the alarm. The bug allows that an\nauthenticated user without a Keystone token with knowledge of trust IDs\nto perform unspecified authenticated actions by adding alarm actions.\n"
