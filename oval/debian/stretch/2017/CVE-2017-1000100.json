    "Description": "When doing a TFTP transfer and curl/libcurl is given a URL that contains a very long file name (longer than about 515 bytes), the file name is truncated to fit within the buffer boundaries, but the buffer size is still wrongly updated to use the untruncated length. This too large value is then used in the sendto() call, making curl attempt to send more data than what is actually put into the buffer. The endto() function will then read beyond the end of the heap based buffer. A malicious HTTP(S) server could redirect a vulnerable libcurl-using client to a crafted TFTP URL (if the client hasn't restricted which protocols it allows redirects to) and trick it to send private memory contents to a remote server over UDP. Limit curl's redirect protocols with --proto-redir and libcurl's with CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3992\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer\nlibrary. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\nEven Rouault reported that cURL does not properly handle long file\n    names when doing an TFTP upload. A malicious HTTP(S) server can take\n    advantage of this flaw by redirecting a client using the cURL\n    library to a crafted TFTP URL and trick it to send private memory\n    contents to a remote server over UDP.\nBrian Carpenter and Yongji Ouyang reported that cURL contains a flaw\n    in the globbing function that parses the numerical range, leading to\n    an out-of-bounds read when parsing a specially crafted URL.\nMax Dymond reported that cURL contains an out-of-bounds read flaw in\n    the FTP PWD response parser. A malicious server can take advantage\n    of this flaw to effectively prevent a client using the cURL library\n    to work with it, causing a denial of service.\n"
