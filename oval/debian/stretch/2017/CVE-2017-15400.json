    "Description": "Insufficient restriction of IPP filters in CUPS in Google Chrome OS prior to 62.0.3202.74 allowed a remote attacker to execute a command with the same privileges as the cups daemon via a crafted PPD file, aka a printer zeroconfig CRLF issue.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4243\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in CUPS, the Common UNIX Printing\nSystem. These issues have been identified with the following CVE ids:\nRory McNamara discovered that an attacker is able to execute arbitrary\n    commands (with the privilege of the CUPS daemon) by setting a\n    malicious IPP server with a crafted PPD file.\nDan Bastone of Gotham Digital Science discovered that a local\n     attacker with access to cupsctl could escalate privileges by setting\n     an environment variable. \nEric Rafaloff and John Dunlap of Gotham Digital Science discovered\n     that a local attacker can perform limited reads of arbitrary files\n     as root by manipulating cupsd.conf.\nDan Bastone of Gotham Digital Science discovered that an attacker\n    can bypass the AppArmor cupsd sandbox by invoking the dnssd backend\n    using an alternate name that has been hard linked to dnssd.\n"
