    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Tor before 0.2.9.15, 0.3.1.x before 0.3.1.10, and 0.3.2.x before 0.3.2.10. The directory-authority protocol-list subprotocol implementation allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and directory-authority crash) via a misformatted relay descriptor that is mishandled during voting.",
