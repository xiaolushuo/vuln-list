    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4331\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.\nHarry Sintonen discovered that, on systems with a 32 bit size_t, an\n    integer overflow would be triggered when a SASL user name longer\n    than 2GB is used. This would in turn cause a very small buffer to be\n    allocated instead of the intended very huge one, which would trigger\n    a heap buffer overflow when the buffer is used.\nBrian Carpenter discovered that the logic in the curl tool to wrap\n    error messages at 80 columns is flawed, leading to a read buffer\n    overflow if a single word in the message is itself longer than 80\n    bytes.\n"
