    "Description": "Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 62, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 60.2.1.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4287\nSeveral security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web\nbrowser: Multiple memory safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to\nthe execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.\nDebian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support\nfor the 52.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now\nfollowing the 60.x releases.\nBetween 52.x and 60.x, Firefox has undergone significant internal\nupdates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For\nmore information please refer to\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/60.0esr/releasenotes/\"\u003e\\\nhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/60.0esr/releasenotes/\u003c/a\u003e\nIn addition, the new Firefox packages require Rust to build. A\ncompatible Rust toolchain has been backported to Debian stretch, but is\nnot available for all architectures which previously supported the\npurely C++-based Firefox packages. Thus, the new Firefox packages\ndon't support the armel, armhf, mips, mips64el and mipsel architectures\nat this point.\n"
