    "Description": "The Squid Software Foundation Squid HTTP Caching Proxy version 3.0 to 3.5.27, 4.0 to 4.0.22 contains a Incorrect Pointer Handling vulnerability in ESI Response Processing that can result in Denial of Service for all clients using the proxy.. This attack appear to be exploitable via Remote server delivers an HTTP response payload containing valid but unusual ESI syntax.. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 4.0.23 and later.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4122\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid3, a fully featured\nweb proxy cache. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following issues:\nLouis Dion-Marcil discovered that Squid does not properly handle\n    processing of certain ESI responses. A remote server delivering\n    certain ESI response syntax can take advantage of this flaw to cause\n    a denial of service for all clients accessing the Squid service.\n    This problem is limited to the Squid custom ESI parser.\n\u003curl \"http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2018_1.txt\" /\u003e\nLouis Dion-Marcil discovered that Squid is prone to a denial of\n    service vulnerability when processing ESI responses or downloading\n    intermediate CA certificates. A remote attacker can take advantage\n    of this flaw to cause a denial of service for all clients accessing\n    the Squid service.\n\u003curl \"http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2018_2.txt\" /\u003e\n"
