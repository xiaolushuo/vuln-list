    "Description": "A vulnerability can occur when capturing a media stream when the media source type is changed as the capture is occurring. This can result in stream data being cast to the wrong type causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 60, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.1, Firefox ESR \u003c 52.9, and Firefox \u003c 61.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4235\nSeveral security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web\nbrowser: Multiple memory safety errors and other implementation errors may\nlead to the execution of arbitrary code, denial of service, cross-site\nrequest forgery or information disclosure.\nDSA-4295\nMultiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory\nsafety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary\ncode or denial of service.\nDebian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x\nseries has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the\n60.x releases.\nBetween 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal\nupdates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For\nmore information please refer to \u003ca href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60\"\u003e\\\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60\u003c/a\u003e\nIn addition, the new Thunderbird packages require Rust to build. A\ncompatible Rust toolchain has been backported to Debian stretch, but is\nnot available for all architectures which previously supported the\npurely C++-based Thunderbird packages. Thus, the new Thunderbird packages\ndon't support the mips, mips64el and mipsel architectures at this point.\n"
