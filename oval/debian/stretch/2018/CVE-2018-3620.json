      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4274\nThis update provides mitigations for the \u003cq\u003eL1 Terminal Fault\u003c/q\u003e\nvulnerability affecting a range of Intel CPUs.\nFor additional information please refer to\n\u003ca href=\"https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-273.html\"\u003ehttps://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-273.html\u003c/a\u003e. The microcode updates\nmentioned there are not yet available in a form distributable by Debian.\nIn addition two denial of service vulnerabilities have been fixed\n(XSA-268 and XSA-269).\nDSA-4279\nMultiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in the way the\nIntel processor designs have implemented speculative execution of\ninstructions in combination with handling of page-faults. This flaw\ncould allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read\nmemory from arbitrary (non-user controlled) addresses, including from\nthe kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross\nguest/host boundaries to read host memory.\nTo fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install\nupdated CPU microcode (only available in Debian non-free). Common server\nclass CPUs are covered in the update released as DSA 4273-1.\n"
