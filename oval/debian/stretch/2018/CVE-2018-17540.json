      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4309\nGoogle's OSS-Fuzz revealed an exploitable bug in the gmp plugin caused by the\npatch that fixes \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16151\"\u003e\\\nCVE-2018-16151\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16152\"\u003e\\\nCVE-2018-16152\u003c/a\u003e (DSA-4305-1).\nAn attacker could trigger it using crafted certificates with RSA keys with\nvery small moduli. Verifying signatures with such keys would cause an integer\nunderflow and subsequent heap buffer overflow resulting in a crash of the\ndaemon. While arbitrary code execution is not completely ruled out because of\nthe heap buffer overflow, due to the form of the data written to the buffer\nit seems difficult to actually exploit it in such a way.\n"
