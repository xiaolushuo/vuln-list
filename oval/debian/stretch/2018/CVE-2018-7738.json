    "Description": "In util-linux before 2.32-rc1, bash-completion/umount allows local users to gain privileges by embedding shell commands in a mountpoint name, which is mishandled during a umount command (within Bash) by a different user, as demonstrated by logging in as root and entering umount followed by a tab character for autocompletion.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4134\nBjorn Bosselmann discovered that the umount bash completion from\nutil-linux does not properly handle embedded shell commands in a\nmountpoint name. An attacker with rights to mount filesystems can take\nadvantage of this flaw for privilege escalation if a user (in particular\nroot) is tricked into using the umount completion while a specially\ncrafted mount is present.\n"
