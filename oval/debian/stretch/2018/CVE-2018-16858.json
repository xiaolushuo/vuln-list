    "Description": "It was found that libreoffice before versions 6.0.7 and 6.1.3 was vulnerable to a directory traversal attack which could be used to execute arbitrary macros bundled with a document. An attacker could craft a document, which when opened by LibreOffice, would execute a Python method from a script in any arbitrary file system location, specified relative to the LibreOffice install location.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4381\nAlex Infuehr discovered a directory traversal vulnerability which could\nresult in the execution of Python script code when opening a malformed\ndocument.\n"
