    "Description": "In fuse before versions 2.9.8 and 3.x before 3.2.5, fusermount is vulnerable to a restriction bypass when SELinux is active. This allows non-root users to mount a FUSE file system with the 'allow_other' mount option regardless of whether 'user_allow_other' is set in the fuse configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file system, accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that file system, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4257\nJann Horn discovered that FUSE, a Filesystem in USErspace, allows the\nbypass of the \u003cq\u003euser_allow_other\u003c/q\u003e restriction when SELinux is active\n(including in permissive mode). A local user can take advantage of this\nflaw in the fusermount utility to bypass the system configuration and\nmount a FUSE filesystem with the \u003cq\u003eallow_other\u003c/q\u003e mount option.\n"
