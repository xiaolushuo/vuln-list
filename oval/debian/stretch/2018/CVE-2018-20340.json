    "Description": "Yubico libu2f-host 1.1.6 contains unchecked buffers in devs.c, which could enable a malicious token to exploit a buffer overflow. An attacker could use this to attempt to execute malicious code using a crafted USB device masquerading as a security token on a computer where the affected library is currently in use. It is not possible to perform this attack with a genuine YubiKey.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4389\nChristian Reitter discovered that libu2f-host, a library implementing\nthe host-side of the U2F protocol, failed to properly check for a\nbuffer overflow. This would allow an attacker with a custom made\nmalicious USB device masquerading as a security key, and physical\naccess to a computer where PAM U2F or an application with libu2f-host\nintegrated, to potentially execute arbitrary code on that computer.\n"
