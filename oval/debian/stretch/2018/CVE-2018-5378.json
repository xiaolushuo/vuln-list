    "Description": "The Quagga BGP daemon (bgpd) prior to version 1.2.3 does not properly bounds check the data sent with a NOTIFY to a peer, if an attribute length is invalid. Arbitrary data from the bgpd process may be sent over the network to a peer and/or bgpd may crash.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4115\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Quagga, a routing\ndaemon. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing issues:\nIt was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, does not\n    properly bounds check data sent with a NOTIFY to a peer, if an\n    attribute length is invalid. A configured BGP peer can take\n    advantage of this bug to read memory from the bgpd process or cause\n    a denial of service (daemon crash).\nhttps://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-0543.txt\nIt was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, can double-free\n    memory when processing certain forms of UPDATE message, containing\n    cluster-list and/or unknown attributes, resulting in a denial of\n    service (bgpd daemon crash).\nhttps://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-1114.txt\nIt was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, does not\n    properly handle internal BGP code-to-string conversion tables.\nhttps://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-1550.txt\nIt was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, can enter an\n    infinite loop if sent an invalid OPEN message by a configured peer.\n    A configured peer can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial\n    of service (bgpd daemon not responding to any other events; BGP\n    sessions will drop and not be reestablished; unresponsive CLI\n    interface).\nhttps://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-1975.txt\n"
