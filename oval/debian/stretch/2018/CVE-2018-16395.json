    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the OpenSSL library in Ruby before 2.3.8, 2.4.x before 2.4.5, 2.5.x before 2.5.2, and 2.6.x before 2.6.0-preview3. When two OpenSSL::X509::Name objects are compared using ==, depending on the ordering, non-equal objects may return true. When the first argument is one character longer than the second, or the second argument contains a character that is one less than a character in the same position of the first argument, the result of == will be true. This could be leveraged to create an illegitimate certificate that may be accepted as legitimate and then used in signing or encryption operations.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4332\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the\nRuby language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nTyler Eckstein reported that the equality check of\n    OpenSSL::X509::Name could return true for non-equal objects. If a\n    malicious X.509 certificate is passed to compare with an existing\n    certificate, there is a possibility to be judged incorrectly that\n    they are equal.\nChris Seaton discovered that tainted flags are not propagated in\n    Array#pack and String#unpack with some directives.\n"
