    "Description": "Incorrect sanitation of the 302 redirect field in HTTP transport method of apt versions 1.4.8 and earlier can lead to content injection by a MITM attacker, potentially leading to remote code execution on the target machine.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4371\nMax Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager.\nThe code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly\nsanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by\nan attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject\nmalicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized\nas a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root\nprivileges on the target machine.\nSince the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is\nrecommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this\nupgrade only, using:\nThis is known to break some proxies when used against security.debian.org. If\nthat happens, people can switch their security APT source to use:\n"
