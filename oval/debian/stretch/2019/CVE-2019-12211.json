    "Description": "When FreeImage 3.18.0 reads a tiff file, it will be handed to the Load function of the PluginTIFF.cpp file, but a memcpy occurs in which the destination address and the size of the copied data are not considered, resulting in a heap overflow.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4593\nIt was found that freeimage, a graphics library, was affected by the\nfollowing two security issues:\nHeap buffer overflow caused by invalid memcpy in PluginTIFF. This\n    flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers to trigger denial of\n    service or any other unspecified impact via crafted TIFF data.\nStack exhaustion caused by unwanted recursion in PluginTIFF. This\n    flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers to trigger denial of\n    service via crafted TIFF data.\n"
