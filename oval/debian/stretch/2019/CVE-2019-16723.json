    "Description": "In Cacti through 1.2.6, authenticated users may bypass authorization checks (for viewing a graph) via a direct graph_json.php request with a modified local_graph_id parameter.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4604\nMultiple issues have been found in cacti, a server monitoring system,\npotentially resulting in SQL code execution or information disclosure by\nauthenticated users.\nAuthenticated users may bypass authorization checks for viewing a graph\n    by submitting requests with modified local_graph_id parameters.\nThe graph administration interface insufficiently sanitizes the\n    template_id parameter, potentially resulting in SQL injection. This\n    vulnerability might be leveraged by authenticated attackers to perform\n    unauthorized SQL code execution on the database.\nThe sanitize_unserialize_selected_items function (lib/functions.php)\n    insufficiently sanitizes user input before deserializing it,\n    potentially resulting in unsafe deserialization of user-controlled\n    data. This vulnerability might be leveraged by authenticated attackers\n    to influence the program control flow or cause memory corruption.\n"
