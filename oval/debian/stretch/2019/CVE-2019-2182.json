    "Description": "In the Android kernel in the kernel MMU code there is a possible execution path leaving some kernel text and rodata pages writable. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4698\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\nHanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the arm64\n    virtual memory management code, which could lead to an information\n    disclosure, denial of service (crash), or possibly privilege\n    escalation.\nMitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11\n    (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger\n    roaming for a newly associated station before the station was\n    authenticated.  An attacker within range of the AP could use this\n    to cause a denial of service, either by filling up a switching\n    table or by redirecting traffic away from other stations.\nJungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4\n    implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks.  A user\n    permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of\n    service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.\nThe syzbot tool found a missing error check in the \u003cq\u003erelay\u003c/q\u003e\n    library used to implement various files under debugfs.  A local\n    user permitted to access debugfs could use this to cause a denial\n    of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\nTristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug\n    facility that could result in a use-after-free.  A local user able\n    to trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to\n    cause a denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.\nA potential null pointer dereference was discovered in the tw5864\n    media driver.  The security impact of this is unclear.\nThe Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an error\n    path in the network subsystem.  The security impact of this is\n    unclear.\nResearchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs\n    supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random\n    value generated by these instructions may be used in a later\n    speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.\n    Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a\n    local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive\n    information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either\n    as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode\n    package in Debian's non-free archive section.  This kernel update\n    only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to\n    disable the mitigation if it is not needed.\nPaulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel\n    processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2\n    guests when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an\n    L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or\n    information leaks in the L1 guest.\nAl Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the filesystem\n    core (vfs).  A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of\n    service (crash) or possibly to obtain sensitive information from\n    the kernel.\nThe Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in\n    the vgacon driver.  A local user permitted to access a virtual\n    terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver\n    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory\n    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\nThe syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal\n    driver, which could result in a use-after-free.  A local user\n    permitted to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a\n    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n    privilege escalation.\nJordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver\n    which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access.  A local user\n    permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a\n    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n    privilege escalation.\nMatthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues in the\n    SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet with null category. A\n    remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of\n    service (crash). Note that this issue does not affect the binary\n    packages distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.\nAn information leak of kernel private memory to userspace was found\n    in the kernel's implementation of core dumping userspace processes.\nDmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly\n    handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged\n    attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.\nFan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX hugepages,\n    allowing a local user to escalate their privileges\nIt was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly\n    validate the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user\n    permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack\n    corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of\n    service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.\nIt was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver\n    did not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets,\n    resulting in an information leak from the kernel to user-space or\n    over the CAN network.\nEntropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did\n    not correctly handle an \u003cq\u003empol\u003c/q\u003e mount option specifying an empty\n    node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user\n    namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a\n    denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\nIt was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media\n    drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors.  A\n    physically present user with a specially constructed USB device\n    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly\n    for privilege escalation.\nPiotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and\n    pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs).  A local user\n    with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use\n    this to cause a denial of service (crash).\nKyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can\n    result in a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this can be\n    exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or\n    memory corruption) or privilege escalation.\nTom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers.\n    An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice,\n    creating a race condition which could result in incorrect locking\n    of internal data structures.  A local user permitted to access\n    /dev/mptctl could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or\n    memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.\nIt was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not\n    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap\n    buffer overflow.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could\n    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)\n    or possibly for privilege escalation.\nIt was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not\n    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an access point\n    (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer overflow.  A malicious AP\n    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory\n    corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.\nIt was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not\n    correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.\n    A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use\n    this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).\nKyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in\n    the USB gadget subsystem.  A local user permitted to write to\n    the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a\n    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially\n    for privilege escalation.\n"
