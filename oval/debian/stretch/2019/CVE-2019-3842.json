    "Description": "In systemd before v242-rc4, it was discovered that pam_systemd does not properly sanitize the environment before using the XDG_SEAT variable. It is possible for an attacker, in some particular configurations, to set a XDG_SEAT environment variable which allows for commands to be checked against polkit policies using the \"allow_active\" element rather than \"allow_any\".",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4428\nJann Horn discovered that the PAM module in systemd insecurely uses the\nenvironment and lacks seat verification permitting spoofing an active\nsession to PolicyKit. A remote attacker with SSH access can take\nadvantage of this issue to gain PolicyKit privileges that are normally\nonly granted to clients in an active session on the local console.\n"
