    "Description": "dbus before 1.10.28, 1.12.x before 1.12.16, and 1.13.x before 1.13.12, as used in DBusServer in Canonical Upstart in Ubuntu 14.04 (and in some, less common, uses of dbus-daemon), allows cookie spoofing because of symlink mishandling in the reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 in the libdbus library. (This only affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism.) A malicious client with write access to its own home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case, this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4462\nJoe Vennix discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in dbus, an\nasynchronous inter-process communication system. The implementation of\nthe DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism was susceptible to a\nsymbolic link attack. A local attacker could take advantage of this flaw\nto bypass authentication and connect to a DBusServer with elevated\nprivileges.\nThe standard system and session dbus-daemons in their default\nconfiguration are not affected by this vulnerability.\nThe vulnerability was addressed by upgrading dbus to a new upstream\nversion 1.10.28 which includes additional fixes.\n"
