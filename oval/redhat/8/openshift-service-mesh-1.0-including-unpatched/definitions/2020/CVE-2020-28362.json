    "Description": "STATEMENT: OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) 1.1 is Out Of Support Scope (OOSS) for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities because it is now in the Maintenance Phase of the support.\nOpenshift Virtualization 1 (formerly Container Native Virtualization) is Out Of Support Scope (OOSS) for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities.\n\nRed Hat Ceph Storage 3 and 4 do not ship the affected code, and are therefore not affected.\n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage 3 shipped multi-cloud-object-gateway-cli and noobaa-operator container as a technical preview and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.\n\nOpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.5 and earlier are built with Go versions earlier than 1.14, which are not affected by this vulnerability. OCP 4.6 is built with Go 1.15 and is affected.",
