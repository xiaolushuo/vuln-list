    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Connect2id Nimbus JOSE+JWT prior to version 7.9. While processing JSON web tokens (JWT), nimbus-jose-jwt can throw various uncaught exceptions resulting in an application crash, information disclosure, or authentication bypass. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and system availability.\n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat Virtualization 4.2, nimbus-jose-jwt was bundled in the rhvm-dependencies package. In Red Hat Virtualization 4.3, nimbus-jose-jwt was made available as a separate package and no longer bundled in rhvm-dependencies. Thus, rhvm-dependencies only contained this vulnerability in the 4.2 EUS stream, the 4.3 version of rhvm-dependencies is not affected.",
