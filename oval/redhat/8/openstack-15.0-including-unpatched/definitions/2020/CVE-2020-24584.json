    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in django. The intermediate-level directories of the file system cache had the system's standard umask rather than `0o077` (no group or others permissions). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw can only be triggered in Django by using Python version 3.7 and newer. Red Hat OpenStack Platform versions 15 and 16 ship Python 3.6.8; 10 and 13 ship Python 2.X. While the flawed package is shipped, the flaw cannot be activated without manually updating Python to a newer release. This change would break many features of Red Hat OpenStack Platform and is an unsupported configuration.",
