    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in rubygem-secure_headers in versions prior to 6.2.0, 5.1.0, and 3.8.0. If user-supplied input was passed into append/override_content_security_policy_directives, a semicolon could be injected leading to directive injection which could be used to override a script-src directive. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.\n            STATEMENT: Satellite 6 ships Secure Header rubygem, however it does not accept any user input in override_content_security_policy_directive or append_content_security_policy_directive. All directives are hard-coded and therefore, Satellite 6 is not vulnerable to this CVE. We may update this rubygem in future release.",
