    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A directive injection vulnerability was found in Secure Headers RubyGem before versions 3.9.0, 5.2.0, and 6.3.0. If user-supplied input was passed into the vulnerable function, a new line could be injected, leading to limited header injection, which could create a new Content Security Policy header in the HTTP response.\n            STATEMENT: Satellite 6 ships Secure Header rubygem, however, it does not accept any user input in override_content_security_policy_directive or append_content_security_policy_directive. All directives are hard-coded and therefor Satellite 6 is not vulnerable to this CVE. We may update this rubygem in future release.",
