    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Tomcat, when serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file system it was possible to bypass security constraints and/or view the source code for JSPs in some configurations. The root cause was the unexpected behaviour of the JRE API File.getCanonicalPath() which in turn was caused by the inconsistent behaviour of the Windows API (FindFirstFileW) in some circumstances. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight, tomcat is disabled by default.  Further, ODL deployments are not supported on untrusted administrator networks; even if tomcat is enabled, if random users can access it, this would be in an unsupported configuration. For this reason, the RHOSP impact has been reduced and no update will be provided at this time for the ODL tomcat package.",
