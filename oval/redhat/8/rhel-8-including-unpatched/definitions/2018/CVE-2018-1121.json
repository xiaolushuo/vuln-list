    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: Since the kernel's proc_pid_readdir() returns PID entries in ascending numeric order, a process occupying a high PID can use inotify events to determine when the process list is being scanned, and fork/exec to obtain a lower PID, thus avoiding enumeration. An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from procps-ng's utilities by exploiting a race condition in reading /proc/PID entries.\n            STATEMENT: The /proc filesystem is not a reliable mechanism to account for processes running on a system, as it is unable to offer snapshot semantics. Short-lived processes have always been able to escape detection by tools that monitor /proc. This CVE simply identifies a reliable way to do so using inotify.\n\nProcess accounting for security purposes, or with a requirement to record very short-running processes and those attempting to evade detection, should be performed with more robust methods such as auditd(8) (the Linux Audit Daemon) or systemtap.",
