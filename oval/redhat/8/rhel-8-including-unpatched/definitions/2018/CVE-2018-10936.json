    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A weakness was found in postgresql-jdbc. It was possible to provide an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host name verifier was not provided to the driver. This could lead to a condition where a man-in-the-middle attacker could masquerade as a trusted server by providing a certificate for the wrong host, as long as it was signed by a trusted CA.\n            \n            MITIGATION: Applications using postgresql-jdbc should have their SSL configuration reviewed to ensure that host name verification is not disabled and only trusted CAs are accepted.\n\nThis vulnerability only impacts usage of postgresql-jdbc with a non-default SSL Factory, provided by the `sslfactory` parameter. If this parameter is not given, the default LibPQFactory is used, which is not vulnerable.",
