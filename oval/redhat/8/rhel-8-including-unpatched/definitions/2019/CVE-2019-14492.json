    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in OpenCV in the way the Cascade Classifier algorithm loaded and processed the Haar feature-based cascade classifiers. This flaw allows a remote attacker to provide a specially crafted classifier in the form of an XML file that, when loaded by an application linked to OpenCV, would crash the application, causing a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: The versions of OpenCV as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 are affected by this flaw. Although it's technically possible that classifiers are loaded from untrusted sources, this is probably an unlikely case in practice.\n            MITIGATION: Avoid loading cascade classifiers from external untrusted sources.",
