    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was discovered in OpenCV. This flaw can be exploited when a small, carefully crafted image is loaded by an application linked to OpenCV. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw, causing a denial of service by causing the application to crash or read sensitive information from memory.\n            STATEMENT: This issue did not affect the versions of OpenCV as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and 7 as they did not include support for DIS optflow algorithm.\nThis issue affects OpenCV as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. However, the package has been built with C++ standard library hardening (_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS) that enables range checks for C++ arrays, vectors, and strings. This leads to an application exit due to an assertion statement and prevents the out-of-bounds read to be exploitable.",
