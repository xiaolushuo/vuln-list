    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: Starting with version 1.5.3, Mercurial allows environment variable expansion on path names for sub repositories when creating it or cloning a parent repository, but it doesn't validate whether the final path name outside the repository root directory. An attacker can leverage this weakness using a combination of symbolic links and environment variables to craft a tampered repository, leading Mercurial to write files outside the repository as long the destination location is empty.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of mercurial as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of Moderate. A future update may address this issue.
