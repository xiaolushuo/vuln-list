    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in jackson-databind 2.x prior to version 2.9.10.4.  The interaction between serialization gadgets and typing is mishandled in the bus-proxy. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n            STATEMENT: While OpenShift Container Platform's elasticsearch plugins do ship the vulnerable component, it doesn't do any of the unsafe things described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.\n\nRed Hat Satellite 6 does not enable polymorphic deserialization which is a required configuration for the vulnerability to be used. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nThe PKI module as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 does not enable polymorphic deserialization which is a required configuration for the vulnerability to be used, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for the Product. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n            MITIGATION: The following conditions are needed for an exploit, we recommend avoiding all if possible\n* Deserialization from sources you do not control\n* `enableDefaultTyping()`\n* `@JsonTypeInfo using `id.CLASS` or `id.MINIMAL_CLASS`",
