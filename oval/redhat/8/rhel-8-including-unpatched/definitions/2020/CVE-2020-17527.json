    "Description": "STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8's Identity Management and Certificate System are using a vulnerable version of Tomcat that is bundled into the pki-servlet-engine component. However, HTTP/2 is not enabled in such a configuration, and it is not possible to trigger the flaw in a supported setup. A future update may fix the code.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7's tomcat package, Identity Management, and Certificate System are all not affected by this flaw because HTTP/2 is not supported in the shipped version of tomcat in those packages.\n\ntomcat5 and tomcat6 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 (respectively) are not affected by this flaw because HTTP/2 is not supported in the shipped versions of those packages.",
