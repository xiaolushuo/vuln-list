    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Tomcat, if an HTTP/2 client exceeded the agreed maximum number of concurrent streams for a connection (in violation of the HTTP/2 protocol), it was possible that a subsequent request made on that connection could contain HTTP headers - including HTTP/2 pseudo headers - from a previous request rather than the intended headers. This could lead to users seeing responses for unexpected resources. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.",
