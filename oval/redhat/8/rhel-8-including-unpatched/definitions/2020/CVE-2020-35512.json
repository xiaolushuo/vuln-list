    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in D-Bus when a system has multiple usernames sharing the same UID. When a set of policy rules references these usernames, D-Bus may free some memory in the heap which is still used by data structures necessary for the other usernames sharing the UID, possibly leading to a crash or other undefined behaviors.\n            STATEMENT: For what concern D-Bus, users with the same UID are treated as the same user. As in Linux multiple assumptions are made based on the fact that a user is identified by its UID, it is not advisable to have multiple users with different privileges but same UID on systems where D-Bus is used. For these reasons this vulnerability has been rated as having Low Impact.",
