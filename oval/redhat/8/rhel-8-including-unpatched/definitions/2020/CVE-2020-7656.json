    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in jquery in versions prior to 1.9.0. A cross-site scripting attack is possible as the load method fails to recognize and remove \"\u003cscript\u003e\" HTML tags that contain a whitespace character which results in the enclosed script logic to be executed. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6, 7 and 8 ship a vulnerable version of JQuery in the `pcs` component. However the vulnerable has not been found to be exploitable in reasonable scenarios. A future update may update JQuery to a fixed version.",
