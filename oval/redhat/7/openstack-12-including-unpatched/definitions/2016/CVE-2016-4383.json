    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An immutability flaw was discovered in openstack-glance, where the glance-manage DB allows deleted image IDs to be reassigned. The flaw could be exploited to allow remote authenticated users to cause other users to boot into a malicious image without knowing it.\n            \n            MITIGATION: For this flaw to be exploited, both non-admin image upload must be permitted and records of deleted IDs must have been purged from the openstack-glance 'images' database table. \nTo prevent flaw exploitation:\n* Do not allow non-admin users to upload images, or\n* If you do permit normal users to upload images, do not purge the 'images' table. Note: It is safe to delete rows from `image_properties`, `image_tags`, `image_members`, and `image_locations` tables.",
