    "Description": "STATEMENT: Red Hat CloudForms 5 uses vulnerable rubygem-json, however, is not vulnerable in Ruby since it does not use version which includes JSON into stdlib.\n\nThis issue affects the version of JSON(embedded in pcs) as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3. However, the vulnerable method calls are currently not used by the product and hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.\n            MITIGATION: To mitigate this vulnerability, do not supply untrusted user input and/or untrusted strings to the following method calls or utilize code libraries which do so:\n\n```\nJSON(user_input)\nJSON[user_input, nil]\nJSON.parse(user_input, nil)\nJSON::Parser.new(user_input).parse\n```\n\nAlso note that JSON.load() should never be given input from unknown sources.",
