    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A validation flaw was found in Django's AdminURLFieldWidget. The clickable Current URL link generated by AdminURLFieldWidget displayed the provided value without validating it as a safe URL. An unvalidated value stored in the database, or a value provided as a URL query parameter payload, could result in a clickable JavaScript link.\n            STATEMENT: * This issue affects the version of python-django as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 as it contains the vulnerable code.\n* This issue does not affect Red Hat Satellite 6, versions 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5, because its django component only returns content-type as JSON, which does not lead to cross site scripting.\n* This issue does not affect Red Hat Update Infrastructure 3 because it does not use any of the Widgets provided by python-django, including AdminURLFieldWidget.\n* This issue does not affect redhat-certification because it does not use AdminURLFieldWidget from python-django package.",
