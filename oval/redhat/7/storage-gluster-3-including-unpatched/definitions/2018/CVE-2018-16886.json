    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: Etcd, versions 3.2.0 through 3.2.25 and 3.3.0 through 3.3.10, are vulnerable to an improper authentication issue when role-based access control (RBAC) is used and client-cert-auth is enabled. If an etcd client server's TLS certificate contains a Common Name (CN) which matches a valid RBAC username, a remote attacker may authenticate as that user with any valid (trusted) client certificate in a REST API request to the gRPC-gateway.\n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform 3.x, and 4.1 versions do not use etcd Role-based access control so they are not affected.\n            MITIGATION: Ensure that the client server TLS certificate (specified in --cert-file argument or ETCD_CERT_FILE environment variable) does not include a CN (Common Name) field. If a Common Name field is part of this certificate, replace it with one which omits it.\n\nTo check the CN field of a certificate:\n  openssl x509 -noout -subject -in /path/to/client.crt | grep -o 'CN.*'\n\nTo check if there is a username matching the CN field in the TLS client certificate:\n  etcdctl user get \u003cTLS client certificate CN\u003e\n\nFor more information on TLS authentication features including how client-cert-auth is enabled, refer to the etcd transport security model documentation: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/security.md\nFor more information on Role-based access control including how it is enabled, refer to the etcd role-based access control documentation: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/authentication.md",
