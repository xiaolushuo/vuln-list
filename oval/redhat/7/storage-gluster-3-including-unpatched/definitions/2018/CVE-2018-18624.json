    "Description": "STATEMENT: Both OpenShift 3.11 and 4.x grafana-container's package a vulnerable version of grafana. However the grafana instance is set to read-only meaning that the potential XSS attack cannot be performed as the table panel cannot be modified or added. As OpenShift still packages the vulnerable code, the components are affected but with impact Low.\n\nIn OpenShift ServiceMesh the grafana component is a vulnerable version, however as it is behind OpenShift OAuth restricting access to authenticated users only the impact is Low.",
