    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was discovered in MongoDB, where an update operation on a user-define role clears the authenticationRestrictions field that was previously set. This unexpected behavior may remove previous IP based restrictions configured on a role, thus allowing a user to bypass them once the update operation is performed.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite Capsule 6.5 ship MongoDB however, package version is not affected to the flaw. All others active streams of Red Hat Satellite and Capsule do not ship MongoDB package. Red Hat Satellite dropped MongoDB in order to unifying database backend, refer following blog for the decision - https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-satellite-standardize-postgresql-backend.\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of mongodb as shipped with Red Hat Update Infrastructure 3 as they did not include support for authenticationRestrictions field in roles.\n            MITIGATION: There is no known mitigation for this issue, the flaw can only be resolved by applying updates.",
