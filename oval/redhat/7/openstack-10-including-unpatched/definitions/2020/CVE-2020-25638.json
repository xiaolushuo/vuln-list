    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in hibernate-core in versions prior to and including 5.4.23.Final. A SQL injection in the implementation of the JPA Criteria API can permit unsanitized literals when a literal is used in the SQL comments of the query. This flaw could allow an attacker to access unauthorized information or possibly conduct further attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight does ship the flawed hibernate-core package. However, OpenDaylight does not use the hibernate feature by default and is therefore not normally vulnerable to sql-injection exploitation. For this reason, the RHOSP impact has been lowered to Moderate and an OpenDaylight update will not be provided at this time.\n            MITIGATION: Set hibernate.use_sql_comments to false, which is the default value, or use named parameters instead of literals. Please refer to details in https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#configurations-logging and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#sql-query-parameters.",
