    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A cryptographic protocol integrity flaw was discovered in Apache Mina. The closure of a TLS session would not always result in closure of the socket, allowing the conversation to continue in clear text. This could undermine the confidentiality of a connection and potentially disclose sensitive information to third-party attackers.\n            STATEMENT: * Red Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight versions 8-10 contain the vulnerable code. However, these OpenDaylight versions were released as technical preview with limited support and will therefore not be updated. Other OpenDaylight versions do not contain the vulnerable library.\n\n* This issue affects the version of apache-mina shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, as it contains the vulnerable functionality.",
