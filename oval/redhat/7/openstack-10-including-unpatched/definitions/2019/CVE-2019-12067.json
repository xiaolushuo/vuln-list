    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the QEMU emulator's IDE AHCI emulator. Exploitation of the flaw could occur while committing DMA buffer in ahci_commit_buf() if the command header 'ad-\u003ecur_cmd' was null. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process instance resulting in DoS. Reduced performance of the system is the highest threat to the system.\n            STATEMENT: The qemu-kvm package versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are not affected by this issue. \n\nThe qemu-kvm package version as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is affected by this issue. Future qemu-kvm updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 may address this issue.",
