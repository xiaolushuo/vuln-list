    "Description": "STATEMENT: libthrift is a library used by OpenDaylight which is shipped with Red Hat OpenStack. Whilst the version of the library used contains the vulnerable code it is not used by OpenDaylight and hence not exposed.\n\nJBoss fuse 6.3 ships libthrift via insight-activemq fabric-8 profile, however the vulnerable code is not used by fabric-8 so fuse 6.3 is not affected.",
