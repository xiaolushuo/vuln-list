    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the mercurial plugin in Jenkins. The XML changelog parser is not configured to prevent an XML external entity (XXE) attack allowing an attacker the ability to control an agent process to have Jenkins parse a crafted changelog file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
