    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Apache Tomcat, where the payload length in a WebSocket frame was not correctly validated. Invalid payload lengths could trigger an infinite loop. Multiple requests with invalid payload lengths could lead to a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Certificate System 10.0 as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8's Identity Management, are using a vulnerable version of Tomcat, bundled into the pki-servlet-engine component. However, there are no entry point for WebSockets, and thus it is not possible to trigger the flaw in a supported setup. A future update may fix the code. Similarly, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 does not ship with websocket functionality enabled by default.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
