Depending on how the library is used, if there is a lack of space to write compressed data, an attacker might exploit this flaw to crash the program or potentially execute arbitrary code.\n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4 temporarily shipped one version of the blosc package in OCP 4.3.0.
