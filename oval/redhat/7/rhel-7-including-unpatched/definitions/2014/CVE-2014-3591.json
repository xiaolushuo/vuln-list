    "Description": "STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw in the libgcrypt and gnupg2 packages.\n            MITIGATION: In order to successfully exploit this flaw the attacker needs to following conditions:\n1. They need to be very close to the system, in order to record the fluctuations in the electromagnetic waves being emitted by the system.\n2. The attacker needs to send specially-crafted cipher text to the system for decryption.\n3. The attacker needs to record the electromagnetic fluctuations when these cipher texts are being decrypted.\n\nThe above conditions can be true only when a laptop is being used for decryption in an unsafe external environment. Typical server setups may not be vulnerable.",
