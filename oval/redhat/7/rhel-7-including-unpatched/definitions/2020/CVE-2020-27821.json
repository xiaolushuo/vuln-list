    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the memory management API of QEMU during the initialization of a memory region cache. This issue could lead to an out-of-bounds write access to the MSI-X table while performing MMIO operations. A guest user may abuse this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw did not affect the versions of `qemu-kvm` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, as they did not include support for the MemoryRegionCache structure.",
