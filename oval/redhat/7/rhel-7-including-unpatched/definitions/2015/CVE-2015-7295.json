    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw has been discovered in the QEMU emulator built with Virtual Network Device(virtio-net) support. If the guest's virtio-net driver did not support big or mergeable receive buffers, an issue could occur while receiving large packets over the tuntap/ macvtap interfaces. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to disable the guest's networking; the user could send a large number of jumbo frames to the guest, which could exhaust all receive buffers, and lead to a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.\n\nThis issue affects the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 based versions of qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.\n\nThis issue affects the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 based versions of the qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.",
