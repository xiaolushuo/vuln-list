    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A NULL-pointer dereference flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built with TPR optimization for 32-bit Windows guests support. The flaw occurs when doing I/O-port write operations from the HMP interface. The 'current_cpu' value remains null because it is not called from the cpu_exec() loop, and dereferencing it results in the flaw. An attacker with access to the HMP interface could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance (denial of service).\n            STATEMENT: This issue does not affect the versions of the kvm and xen packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis issue does not affect the versions of the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 based versions of qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nThis issue affects the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 based versions of the qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.\n\nThis has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently\nplanned to be addressed in future updates.
