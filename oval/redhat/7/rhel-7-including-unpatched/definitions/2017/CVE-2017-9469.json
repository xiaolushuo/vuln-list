    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An out-of-bound heap read was found in irssi's get_file_params_count() function, during the parsing of a DCC SEND request. An IRC client connected to the same IRC network as the target could send a specially crafted request that would force irssi to read 1 byte outside of an allocated string, which could, possibly, lead to an invalid memory read.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
