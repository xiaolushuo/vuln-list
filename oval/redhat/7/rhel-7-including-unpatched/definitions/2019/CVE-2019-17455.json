    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the libntlm NTLM library where it was vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the buildSmbNtlmAuthRequest_userlen() function. If an application using this library does not check input length before calling the function, an attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted request that could crash the application, or possibly trigger code execution.\n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability is rated Medium because no package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 6 and 7 is using Libntlm. Most 3rd party applications using Libntlm are command line clients and would be affected via a command line option or a configuration file, which are local vectors.\n            MITIGATION: The calling application must verify that the input  username and domain fit in the 1024 byte buffer.",
