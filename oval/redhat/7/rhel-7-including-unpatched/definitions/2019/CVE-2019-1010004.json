    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in sox, due to insufficient validation of input data. An attacker could abuse this flaw by crafting a sound file that can cause the system to crash when read by sox or by an application using the sox library.\n            STATEMENT: This issue is only a security vulnerability for applications linking against libsox, that may be caused to crash prematurely or even, under special circumstances, disclose sensitive memory contents. Attacks against the sox binaries do not constitute a security threat since these are all short-run programs that do not hold sensitive data in memory.",
