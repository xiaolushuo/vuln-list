    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in vim in the restricted mode, where all commands that make use of external shells are disabled. However, it was found that users could still execute some arbitrary OS commands in the restricted mode. This flaw was fixed by filtering the functions that can call OS commands. Interfaces such as Python, Ruby, and Lua, are also disabled, as they can be used to execute shell commands. Perl uses the Safe module.\n            STATEMENT: Upstream suggests that users may still find loopholes to execute a shell commands, it has only been made difficult. So administrators should not assume that vim restricted mode will completely disable execution of OS commands.",
