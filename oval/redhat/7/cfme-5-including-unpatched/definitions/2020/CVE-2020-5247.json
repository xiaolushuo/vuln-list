    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was discovered in rubygem-puma, where it did not properly forbid untrusted input in a response header. This flaw allows an attacker with the ability to tamper with HTTP headers to insert a new-line and insert malicious content, allowing an HTTP response splitting, which exposes the risk of attacks such as cross-site scripting.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the version of rubygem-puma shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, as it does not validate whether the header value could inject a CR or LF and inject their own HTTP response.\n\nRed Hat CloudForms uses affected RubyGem Puma, however, it is not vulnerable since it does not have custom code enabling early hints, HTTP/2 support or way to return 103 response. A future update may fix affected RubyGem.",
