    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind, where it would permit polymorphic deserialization of malicious objects using the c3p0 gadget when used in conjunction with polymorphic type handling methods such as `enableDefaultTyping()` or when @JsonTypeInfo is using `Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS` or in any other way which ObjectMapper.readValue might instantiate objects from unsafe sources. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code.\n            STATEMENT: Subscription Asset Manager is now in a reduced support phase receiving only Critical impact security fixes. This issue has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.\n\nSatellite 6.2 does not support c3p0 classes. Since the latter are required for this flaw, therefore Satellite 6.2 is not affected.  Satellite 6.3 and 6.4 are not affected because Candlepin does not use polymorphic deserialization.\n            MITIGATION: Advice on how to remain safe while using JAX-RS webservices on JBoss EAP 7.x is available here:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/JacksonPolymorphicDeserialization\n\nGeneral Mitigation: \nTry to avoid  \n* Deserialization from sources you do not control\n* `enableDefaultTyping()`\n* `@JsonTypeInfo using `id.CLASS` or `id.MINIMAL_CLASS`",
