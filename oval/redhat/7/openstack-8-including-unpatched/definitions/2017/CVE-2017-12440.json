    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A verification flaw was found in openstack-aodh. As part of an HTTP alarm action, a user could pass in a trust ID. However, the trust could be from anyone because it was not verified. Because the trust was then used by openstack-aodh to obtain a keystone token for the alarm action, a malicious user could pass in another person's trust ID and obtain a keystone token containing the delegated authority of that user.",
