    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Go encoding/binary package. Certain invalid inputs to ReadUvarint or ReadVarint could cause those functions to read an unlimited number of bytes from the ByteReader argument before returning an error. This could lead to processing more input than expected.\n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM), RedHat OpenShift Jaeger (RHOSJ) and OpenShift Virtualization components are primarily written in Go, meaning that any component using the encoding/binary package includes the vulnerable code. The affected components are behind OpenShift OAuth authentication, therefore the impact is low.\n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage 3, Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage 4 and Red Hat Ceph Storage (3 and 4)  components are built with the affected version of Go, however the vulnerable functionality is currently not used by these products and hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.",
