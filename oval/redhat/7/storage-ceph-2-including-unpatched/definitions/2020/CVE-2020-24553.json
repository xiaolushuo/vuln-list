    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Go standard library packages before upstream versions 1.15 and 1.14.8. Both the net/http/cgi and net/http/fcgi packages use a default Content-Type response header value of \"text/html\", rather than \"text/plain\". An attacker could exploit this in applications using these packages by uploading crafted files, allowing for a cross-site scripting attack (XSS).\n            STATEMENT: Multiple components in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform are built with Go and use net/http, however none include the specific vulnerable packages net/http/cgi and net/http/fcgi. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is not affected by this flaw.",
