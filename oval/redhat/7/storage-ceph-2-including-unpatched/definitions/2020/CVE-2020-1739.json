    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Ansible Engine. When a password is set with the argument \"password\" of svn module, it is used on svn command line, disclosing to other users within the same node. An attacker could take advantage by reading the cmdline file from that particular PID on the procfs.\n            STATEMENT: Ansible Engine 2.7.16, 2.8.10, and 2.9.6 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nAnsible Tower 3.4.5, 3.5.5 and 3.6.3 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact,  ansible is not directly customer exposed, and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.\n            MITIGATION: Instead of using the parameter 'password' of the subversion module, provide the password with stdin.",
