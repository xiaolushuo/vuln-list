    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The User module in Ansible leaks any data which is passed on as a parameter to ssh-keygen. This could lead to undesirable situations such as passphrase credentials being passed as a parameter for the ssh-keygen executable, showing those credentials in clear text form for every user which have access just to the process list.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the version of ansible as shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 3, as it contains the vulnerable code which leaks the data when ssh-keygen is invoked with any arguments.",
