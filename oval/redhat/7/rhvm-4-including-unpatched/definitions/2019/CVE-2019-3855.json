    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An integer overflow flaw which could lead to an out of bounds write was discovered in libssh2 in the way packets are read from the server. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw was present in libssh2 packages included in Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor and Management Appliance, however libssh2 in these hosts is never exposed to malicious clients or servers.",
