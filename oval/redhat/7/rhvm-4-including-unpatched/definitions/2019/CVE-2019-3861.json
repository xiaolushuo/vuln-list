    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 in the way SSH packets with a padding length value greater than the packet length are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to cause a denial of service or read data in the client memory.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw was present in libssh2 packages included in Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor and Management Appliance, however libssh2 in these hosts is never exposed to malicious clients or servers.",
