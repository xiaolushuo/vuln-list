    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A use-after-free flaw was found in the way httpd handled invalid and previously unregistered HTTP methods specified in the Limit directive used in an .htaccess file. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose portions of the server memory, or cause httpd child process to crash.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7. This issue affects the versions of httpd24-httpd as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections. Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact.\n\nIn order to be vulnerable, .htaccess files need to contain an invalid or not globally registered HTTP method in a \"Limit\" directive.\n            MITIGATION: This issue can be mitigated by configuring httpd to disallow the use of the \"Limit\" configuration directive in .htaccess files. The set of directives that can be used in .htaccess files is configured using the \"AllowOverride\" directive.
