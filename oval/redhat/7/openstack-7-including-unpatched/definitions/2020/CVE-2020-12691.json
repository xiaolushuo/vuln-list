    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in Keystone's EC2 credentials API. This flaw allows any authenticated user to create an EC2 credential for themselves for a project that they have a specified role, and then perform an update to the credential user and project, allowing them to masquerade as another user. This issue potentially allows the malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, granting the user global admin privileges.",
