    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A denial of service vulnerability was found in the SSH package of the golang.org/x/crypto library. An attacker could exploit this flaw by supplying crafted SSH ed25519 keys to cause a crash in applications that use this package as either an SSH client or server.\n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform uses the vulnerable library in a number of components but strictly as an SSH client. The severity of this vulnerability is reduced for clients as it requires connections to malicious SSH servers, with the maximum impact only a client crash. This vulnerability is rated Low for OpenShift Container Platform.",
