    "Description": "STATEMENT: In both OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) and OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) the affected components are behind OpenShift OAuth authentication. This restricts access to the vulnerable nodejs-y18n library to authenticated users only, therefore the impact is Low.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage 4 the noobaa-core container includes the affected version of y18n as a dependency of yargs. However, no unsafe usage found where the module accepts untrusted input and hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.",
