    "Description": "STATEMENT: * In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP), the affected components are behind OpenShift OAuth authentication. This restricts access to the vulnerable etcd to authenticated users only.\n* In Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the use of etcd is limited to the internal API network, which is not accessible to OpenStack tenants.\n\nThe security impact for these products is therefore rated as Low.",
