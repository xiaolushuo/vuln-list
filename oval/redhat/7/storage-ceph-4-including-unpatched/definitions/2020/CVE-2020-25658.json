    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in python-rsa, where it is vulnerable to Bleichenbacher timing attacks. This flaw allows an attacker, via the RSA decryption API, to decrypt parts of the ciphertext encrypted with RSA. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-rsa package.",
