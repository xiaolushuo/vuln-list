    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: Prior to Karaf 3.0.9, Karaf 4.0.9, and Karaf 4.1.1, HTTP endpoints published by Karaf features may also be published under the HTTP web root, in addition to the paths specifically configured by the installed feature. Authentication and access control rules may not cover this additional path, potentially leading to authentication bypass on published features. The Gogo shell provided by the webconsole feature is potentially accessible without authentication as a result.\n            STATEMENT: Open Daylight: The webconsole feature is not installed by default. In RHOSP12 and earlier, when the webconsole feature is installed, the gogo webshell potentially provides access to the Karaf console without authentication.",
