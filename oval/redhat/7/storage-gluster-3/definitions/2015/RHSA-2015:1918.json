    "Description": "Red Hat Gluster Storage is a software only scale-out storage solution that\nprovides flexible and affordable unstructured data storage. It unifies data\nstorage and infrastructure, increases performance, and improves\navailability and manageability to meet enterprise-level storage challenges.\n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage's Unified File and Object Storage is built on\nOpenStack's Object Storage (swift).\n\nA flaw was found in the way swiftonfile (gluster-swift) serialized and\nstored metadata on disk by using Python's pickle module. A remote,\nauthenticated user could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the\nstorage node. (CVE-2015-5242)\n\nFor more information about CVE-2015-5242, please see\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/1985893\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Bill Owen of IBM for reporting this issue.\n\nAll swiftonfile users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct this issue.",
