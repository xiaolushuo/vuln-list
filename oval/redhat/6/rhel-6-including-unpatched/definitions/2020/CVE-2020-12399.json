    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the DSA signature generation function in nss. During the process of generating a DSA signature, the nonce value 'k' is not padded, exposing the bit length. Combined with other techniques, this can result in the recovery of the DSA private key. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: A timing attack was found in the way NSS generated DSA signatures. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this attack during DSA signature generation to recover the private key. This attack is only feasible when the attacker is local to the machine or in certain cross-VM scenarios where the signature is being generated. Attacks over the network or via the internet are not feasible.\n\nFirefox and Thunderbird on Red Hat Enterprise Linux are built against the system nss library.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
