    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in NSS, where it is vulnerable to RSA key generation cache timing side-channel attacks. An attacker with sufficient access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process could recover the private key. The highest threat to this flaw is to confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: A timing attack was found in the way NSS generated RSA keys. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this attack during RSA key generation to recover the private key. This attack is only feasible when the attacker is local to the machine or in certain cross-VM scenarios where the signature is being generated. Attacks over the network or via the internet are not feasible.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
