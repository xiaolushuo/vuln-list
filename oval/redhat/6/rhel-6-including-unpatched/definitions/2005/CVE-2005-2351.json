    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An insecure temporary file vulnerability was found in the way mutt created temporary files under /tmp. Specifically, mutt created temporary files in an insecure way, using only predictable elements such as the hostname, user ID (uid) and process ID (pid). A local attacker could exploit this flaw to create those temporary files beforehand, causing a denial of service by preventing the user from using mutt.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw does not affect versions of mutt as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 as they already include the patch.",
