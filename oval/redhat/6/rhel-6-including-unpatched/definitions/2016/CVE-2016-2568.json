    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that pkexec was vulnerable to TIOCSTI ioctl attacks, allowing the executed program to push characters to its TTY's input buffer. While being executed as a non-privileged user, a specially crafted program could force its parent TTY to enter commands, interpreted by the shell when pkexec exits.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of polkit as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. A future update may address this issue.
