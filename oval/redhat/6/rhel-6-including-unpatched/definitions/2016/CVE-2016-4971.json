    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that wget used a file name provided by the server for the downloaded file when following a HTTP redirect to a FTP server resource. This could cause wget to create a file with a different name than expected, possibly allowing the server to execute arbitrary code on the client.\n            \n            MITIGATION: Use wget with \"-O\" option to explicitly specify the output filename.",
