    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in c-ares. A hostname with an escaped trailing dot (such as \"hello\\.\") would have its size calculated incorrectly, leading to a single byte written beyond the end of a buffer on the heap. An attacker able to provide such a hostname to an application using c-ares, could potentially cause that application to crash.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.",
