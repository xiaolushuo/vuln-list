    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys.\n            STATEMENT: In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker needs to be have local (shell) access to the machine where the message is being signed using the ECDSA algorithm with a P-256 elliptic curve key. Then using cache timing attacks (which needs precise timing), on multiple signature runs, the private key could be obtained. Based on the factor that exploitation is difficult, Red Hat Product Security Team has rated this flaw as having Moderate impact. A further security release may address this flaw.",
