    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in python. A stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in the ctypes module provided within Python. Applications that use ctypes without carefully validating the input passed to it may be vulnerable to this flaw, which would allow an attacker to overflow a buffer on the stack and crash the application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw could have had a higher Impact, however our packages are compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE, which provides runtime protection to some memory and string functions and prevents this flaw from actually overwriting the buffer and potentially executing code.",
