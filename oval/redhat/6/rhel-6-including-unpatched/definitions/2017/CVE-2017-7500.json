    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that rpm did not properly handle RPM installations when a destination path was a symbolic link to a directory, possibly changing ownership and permissions of an arbitrary directory, and RPM files being placed in an arbitrary destination. An attacker, with write access to a directory in which a subdirectory will be installed, could redirect that directory to an arbitrary location and gain root privilege.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
