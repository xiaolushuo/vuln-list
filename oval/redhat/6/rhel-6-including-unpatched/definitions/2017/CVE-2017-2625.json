    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was discovered that libXdmcp used weak entropy to generate session keys. On a multi-user system using xdmcp, a local attacker could potentially use information available from the process list to brute force the key, allowing them to hijack other users' sessions.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
