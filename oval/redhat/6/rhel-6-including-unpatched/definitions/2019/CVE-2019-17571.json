    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was discovered in Log4j, where a vulnerable SocketServer class may lead to the deserialization of untrusted data. This flaw allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code when combined with a deserialization gadget.\n            STATEMENT: This is the same issue as CVE-2017-5645. MITRE has CVE-2017-5645 to a similar flaw found in log4j-2.x. The flaw found in log4j-1.2 has been assigned CVE-2019-17571. CVE-2019-17571 has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux via RHSA-2017:2423.\nAlso the rh-java-common-log4j package shipped with Red Hat Software Collections was addressed via RHSA-2017:1417\n\nIn Satellite 5.8, although the version of log4j as shipped in the nutch package is affected, nutch does not load any of the SocketServer classes from log4j. Satellite 5 is considered not vulnerable to this flaw since the affected code can not be reached.",
