    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in exiv2. An integer wraparound could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the way MemIo is implemented. Reading from the memory buffer with MemIo::Impl::read() reads data beyond the buffer’s limits. An attacker could abuse this flaw by providing a specially crafted image that when read, would cause the application to crash or to leak sensitive data.\n            STATEMENT: This issue did not affect the versions of exiv2 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and 8 as variables MemIo::Impl::size_ and MemIo::Impl::idx_ are of type long, making it impossible to trigger the integer wraparound that would lead to an out-of-bound read.",
