    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way squid processed certain Uniform Resource Names (URNs). A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause Squid to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Squid.\n            STATEMENT: This is a heap-based buffer overflow, which can be triggered by a malicious client. The client can overwrite substantial amount of heap potentially causing squid to crash or even execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running squid (normally squid user which is non-privileged). Also on Red Hat Products, squid is confined with selinux which should reduce the possibilities of code execution.\n\nBecause of the above mentioned difficulties in exploitation, Red Hat Product Security has classified this flaw as having Moderate impact.\n            MITIGATION: The following mitigation is suggested by upstream:\n\nDeny urn: protocol URI being proxied to all clients:\n~~~\n    acl URN proto URN\n    http_access deny URN\n~~~",
