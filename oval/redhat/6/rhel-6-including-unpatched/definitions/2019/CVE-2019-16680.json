    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in the file-roller (Archive Manager for GNOME) in the way file paths with special characters are sanitized. Archives containing the sequence of characters \"../\" in a file path may be vulnerable to this flaw. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted archive with a file inside one or more sub-directories. When opened by a victim, the file-roller would extract the file in the current working directory instead of a sub-directory, as it may be expected by inspecting the archive.\n            \n            MITIGATION: Avoid using file-roller (Archive Manager for GNOME) to extract untrusted archives, use the suitable command line utilities instead (such as `tar` or `unzip`).",
