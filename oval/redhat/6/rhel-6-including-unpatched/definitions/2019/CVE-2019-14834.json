    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Dnsmasq application where a remote attacker can trigger a memory leak by sending specially crafted DHCP responses to the server. A successful attack is dependent on a specific configuration regarding the domain name set into the dnsmasq.conf file. Over time, the memory leak may cause the process to run out of memory and terminate, causing a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, which currently supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7, the dnsmasq package is pulled directly from the rhel-7-server-rpms channel. Red Hat OpenStack Platform's version is therefore unused, please ensure that the underlying Red Hat Enterprise Linux dnsmasq package is current.",
