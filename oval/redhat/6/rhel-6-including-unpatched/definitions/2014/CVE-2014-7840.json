    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that certain values that were read when loading RAM during migration were not validated. A user able to alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise \nLinux 5, 6 and 7. Future updates for the respective releases may address this \nissue.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and \nmaintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Moderate security impact \nand is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional \ninformation, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: \nhttps://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
