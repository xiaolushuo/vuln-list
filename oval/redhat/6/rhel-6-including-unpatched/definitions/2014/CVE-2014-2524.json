    "Description": "STATEMENT: This issue is only exposed via readline's debugging/tracing code and is not used by readline or any other application in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  The tracing functions are defined in a private header file and are only meant for the readline library's internal use.  In general use, there is no exposure of this insecure temporary file issue, and while this does affect the versions of readline as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7 it is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact.
