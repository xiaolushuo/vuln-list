    "Description": "STATEMENT: The \"FilesMatch\" directive is not enabled in the default httpd configuration as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and needs to be explicitly enabled. Therefore this flaw has no impact on the default versions of the httpd package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\nRed Hat Satellite 6 uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7's httpd package, and enables the \"FilesMatch\" directive. However, this is not believed to have an impact on security, as, in the context of a Satellite, no one is expected to have the ability to modify file names in the concerned directories. This is not considered as a vector for attack.",
