    "Description": "STATEMENT: The github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go module is an indirect dependency of the k8s.io/client-go module pulled into Quay Bridge, and Setup operators via the Operator's SDK generated code. The k8s.io/client-go module does not use jwt-go in an unsafe way [1]. Red Hat Quay components have been marked as wontfix. This may be fixed in the future.\n\nSimilar to Quay, multiple OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) containers include jwt-go as a transient dependency due to go-autorest [1]. As such, those containers do not use jwt-go in an unsafe way. They have been marked wontfix at this time and may be fixed in a future update.\n\nSame as Quay and OpenShift Container Platform, components shipped with Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage 4 do not use jwt-go in an unsafe way and hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low. A future update may address this issue.\n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage 3 shipped multi-cloud-object-gateway-cli as a technical preview and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates, hence the multi-cloud-object-gateway-cli package will not be fixed.\n\n[1] https://github.com/Azure/go-autorest/issues/568#issuecomment-703804062",
