  "description": "By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 68.6, Firefox \u003c 74, Firefox \u003c ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR \u003c 68.6.",
