  "description": "By holding a reference to the eval() function from an about:blank window, a malicious webpage could have gained access to the InstallTrigger object which would allow them to prompt the user to install an extension. Combined with user confusion, this could result in an unintended or malicious extension being installed. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 80, Thunderbird \u003c 78.2, Thunderbird \u003c 68.12, Firefox ESR \u003c 68.12, Firefox ESR \u003c 78.2, and Firefox for Android \u003c 80.",
