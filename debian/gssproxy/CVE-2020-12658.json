  "description": "** DISPUTED ** gssproxy (aka gss-proxy) before 0.8.3 does not unlock cond_mutex before pthread exit in gp_worker_main() in gp_workers.c. NOTE: An upstream comment states \"We are already on a shutdown path when running the code in question, so a DoS there doesn't make any sense, and there has been no additional information provided us (as upstream) to indicate why this would be a problem.\"",
