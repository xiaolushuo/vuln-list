  "description": "An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.17 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.8.0. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \\r\\n (specifically in the host component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the CVE-2019-9947 path string issue. (This is not exploitable when glibc has CVE-2016-10739 fixed.)",
