  "description": "A flaw was found in all ipa versions 4.x.x through 4.8.0. When sending a very long password (\u003e= 1,000,000 characters) to the server, the password hashing process could exhaust memory and CPU leading to a denial of service and the website becoming unresponsive. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
