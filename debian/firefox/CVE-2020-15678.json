  "description": "When recursing through graphical layers while scrolling, an iterator may have become invalid, resulting in a potential use-after-free. This occurs because the function APZCTreeManager::ComputeClippedCompositionBounds did not follow iterator invalidation rules. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 81, Thunderbird \u003c 78.3, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.3.",
