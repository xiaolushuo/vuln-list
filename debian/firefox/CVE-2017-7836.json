  "description": "The \"pingsender\" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges. Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 57.",
