  "description": "A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5. A lack of bounds checking when copying iv_data from the VM guest memory into host memory can lead to a large buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
