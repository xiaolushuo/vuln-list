  "description": "A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5. A complete lack of validation of attacker-controlled parameters can lead to a buffer over read. The results of the over read are then written back to the guest virtual machine memory. This vulnerability can be used by an attacker in a virtual machine to read significant amounts of host memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and system availability.",
