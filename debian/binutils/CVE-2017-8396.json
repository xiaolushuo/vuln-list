  "description": "The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read of size 1 because the existing reloc offset range tests didn't catch small negative offsets less than the size of the reloc field. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objdump, to crash.",
