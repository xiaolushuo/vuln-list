  "description": "The Mozilla Maintenance Service \"helper.exe\" application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access. Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 52.2 and Firefox \u003c 54.",
