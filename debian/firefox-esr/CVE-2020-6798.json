  "description": "If a template tag was used in a select tag, the parser could be confused and allow JavaScript parsing and execution when it should not be allowed. A site that relied on the browser behaving correctly could suffer a cross-site scripting vulnerability as a result. In general, this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 68.5, Firefox \u003c 73, and Firefox \u003c ESR68.5.",
