  "description": "A flaw was found in the memory management API of QEMU during the initialization of a memory region cache. This issue could lead to an out-of-bounds write access to the MSI-X table while performing MMIO operations. A guest user may abuse this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service. This flaw affects QEMU versions prior to 5.2.0.",
