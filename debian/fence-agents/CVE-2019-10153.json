  "description": "A flaw was discovered in fence-agents, prior to version 4.3.4, where using non-ASCII characters in a guest VM's comment or other fields would cause fence_rhevm to exit with an exception. In cluster environments, this could lead to preventing automated recovery or otherwise denying service to clusters of which that VM is a member.",
