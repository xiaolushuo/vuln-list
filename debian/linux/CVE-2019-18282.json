  "description": "The flow_dissector feature in the Linux kernel 4.3 through 5.x before 5.3.10 has a device tracking vulnerability, aka CID-55667441c84f. This occurs because the auto flowlabel of a UDP IPv6 packet relies on a 32-bit hashrnd value as a secret, and because jhash (instead of siphash) is used. The hashrnd value remains the same starting from boot time, and can be inferred by an attacker. This affects net/core/flow_dissector.c and related code.",
