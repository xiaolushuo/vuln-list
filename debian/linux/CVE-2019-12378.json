  "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: This has been disputed as not an issue.",
