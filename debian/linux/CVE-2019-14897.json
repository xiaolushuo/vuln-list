  "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel, version kernel-2.6.32, in Marvell WiFi chip driver. An attacker is able to cause a denial of service (system crash) or, possibly execute arbitrary code, when a STA works in IBSS mode (allows connecting stations together without the use of an AP) and connects to another STA.",
