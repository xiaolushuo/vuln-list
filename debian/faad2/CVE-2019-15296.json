  "description": "An issue was discovered in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8. The faad_resetbits function in libfaad/bits.c is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability. The number of bits to be read is determined by ld-\u003ebuffer_size - words*4, cast to uint32. If ld-\u003ebuffer_size - words*4 is negative, a buffer overflow is later performed via getdword_n(\u0026ld-\u003estart[words], ld-\u003ebytes_left).",
