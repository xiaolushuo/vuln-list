  "description": "An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource record-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing compressed labels in mDNS messages, the compression pointer is followed without checking for recursion, leading to a denial of service. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.",
