  "description": "The bubblewrap sandbox of WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit, prior to 2.28.3, failed to properly block access to CLONE_NEWUSER and the TIOCSTI ioctl. CLONE_NEWUSER could potentially be used to confuse xdg-desktop-portal, which allows access outside the sandbox. TIOCSTI can be used to directly execute commands outside the sandbox by writing to the controlling terminal's input buffer, similar to CVE-2017-5226.",
