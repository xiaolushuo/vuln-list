  "description": "Libgcrypt before 1.5.4, as used in GnuPG and other products, does not properly perform ciphertext normalization and ciphertext randomization, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to conduct key-extraction attacks by leveraging the ability to collect voltage data from exposed metal, a different vector than CVE-2013-4576.",
