The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SIP packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an integer underflow, causing the software to try to read unmapped memory and resulting in a crash."
