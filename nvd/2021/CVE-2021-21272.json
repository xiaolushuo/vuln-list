ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module.\n\nIn ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability.\n\nThe directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links.\n\nA well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. \n\nUsers of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`.\n\nThe problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0.\n\nFor `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider.\n\nFor `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider."
