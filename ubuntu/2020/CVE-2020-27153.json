  "Description": "In BlueZ before 5.55, a double free was found in the gatttool disconnect_cb() routine from shared/att.c. A remote attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or code execution, during service discovery, due to a redundant disconnect MGMT event.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e per Red Hat, there is currently no known path to code execution",
    "mdeslaur\u003e as there is a small time window between the two calls to free()",
    "mdeslaur\u003e as such, marking as low priority."
