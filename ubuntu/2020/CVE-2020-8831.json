  "Description": "Apport creates it's lock file as root owned with world-writable permissions in a world-writable directory (/var/lock/apport). This could allow an unprivileged user to escalate their privileges to root by creating a symlink at /var/lock/apport to redirect where the lock file is created and then replacing the contents of the lock file in a subsequent operation.",
