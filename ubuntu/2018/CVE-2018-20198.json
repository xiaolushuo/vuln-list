  "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in ifilter_bank of libfaad/filtbank.c in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service because adding to windowed output is mishandled in the LONG_START_SEQUENCE case.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 incorrectly handled implicit channel mapping reconfiguration when processing crafted AAC files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
