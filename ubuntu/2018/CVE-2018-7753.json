  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Bleach 2.1.x before 2.1.3. Attributes that have URI values weren't properly sanitized if the values contained character entities. Using character entities, it was possible to construct a URI value with a scheme that was not allowed that would slide through unsanitized.",
