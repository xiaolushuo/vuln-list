  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the cantata-mounter D-Bus service in Cantata through 2.3.1. The mount target path check in mounter.cpp `mpOk()` is insufficient. A regular user can consequently mount a CIFS filesystem anywhere (e.g., outside of the /home directory tree) by passing directory traversal sequences such as a home/../usr substring.",
