  "Description": "In opencv/modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_pxm.cpp, function ReadNumber did not checkout the input length, which lead to integer overflow. If the image is from remote, may lead to remote code execution or denial of service. This affects Opencv 3.3 and earlier.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that OpenCV incorrectly handled certain image files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.",
