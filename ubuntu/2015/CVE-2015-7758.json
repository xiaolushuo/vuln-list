  "Description": "Gummi 0.6.5 allows local users to write to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a temporary dot file that uses the name of an existing file and a (1) .aux, (2) .log, (3) .out, (4) .pdf, or (5) .toc extension for the file name, as demonstrated by .thesis.tex.aux.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that Gummi created unsafe, predictable filenames in /tmp, resulting in a race condition. An attacker could use this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files.",
