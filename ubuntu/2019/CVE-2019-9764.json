  "Description": "HashiCorp Consul 1.4.3 lacks server hostname verification for agent-to-agent TLS communication. In other words, the product behaves as if verify_server_hostname were set to false, even when it is actually set to true. This is fixed in 1.4.4.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "amurray| Upstream says this only affects 1.4.3 and is fixed in 1.4.4 but it is not clear if earlier versions were affected or not so leaving as needs-triage for bionic with version 0.6.4~dfsg-3"
