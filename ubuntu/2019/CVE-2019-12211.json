  "Description": "When FreeImage 3.18.0 reads a tiff file, it will be handed to the Load function of the PluginTIFF.cpp file, but a memcpy occurs in which the destination address and the size of the copied data are not considered, resulting in a heap overflow.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that FreeImage incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted TIFF file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause a heap buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service attack.",
