  "Description": "An infinite recursion issue was discovered in eval.c in Netwide Assembler (NASM) through 2.14.02. There is a stack exhaustion problem resulting from infinite recursion in the functions expr, rexp, bexpr and cexpr in certain scenarios involving lots of '{' characters. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted asm file.",
