  ],
  "Description": "A Denial of Service issue was discovered in the LIVE555 Streaming Media libraries as used in Live555 Media Server 0.93. It can cause an RTSPServer crash in handleHTTPCmd_TunnelingPOST, when RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling is supported, via x-sessioncookie HTTP headers in a GET request and a POST request within the same TCP session. This occurs because of a call to an incorrect virtual function pointer in the readSocket function in GroupsockHelper.cpp.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that liveMedia incorrectly handled certain network sessions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
