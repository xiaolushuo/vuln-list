  "Description": "In libssh2 v1.9.0 and earlier versions, the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read. A crafted SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled bound checks in SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information.",
