    "CRLF injection vulnerability in the Ceph Object Gateway (aka radosgw or RGW) in Ceph before 0.94.4 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via a crafted bucket name.",
    "A feature in Ceph Object Gateway (RGW) allows to return a specific HTTP header that contains the name of a bucket that was accessed. It was found that the returned HTTP headers were not sanitized. An unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to craft HTTP headers in responses that would confuse the load balancer residing in front of RGW, potentially resulting in a denial of service."
