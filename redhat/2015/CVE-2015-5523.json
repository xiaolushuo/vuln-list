    "\nThe ParseValue function in lexer.c in tidy before 4.9.31 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors involving multiple whitespace characters before an empty href, which triggers a large memory allocation.\n    ",

By tricking an application that is using tidy into processing a specially crafted HTML document, a remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected application.\n    "
