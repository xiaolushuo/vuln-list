    "\nThe virtnet_probe function in drivers/net/virtio_net.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2 attempts to support a FRAGLIST feature without proper memory allocation, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and memory corruption) via a crafted sequence of fragmented packets.\n    ",
    "\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's virtio-net subsystem handled certain fraglists when the GRO (Generic Receive Offload) functionality was enabled in a bridged network configuration. An attacker on the local network could potentially use this flaw to crash the system, or, although unlikely, elevate their privileges on the system.\n    "
