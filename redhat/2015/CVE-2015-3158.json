  "details": [
    "\nThe invokeNextValve function in identity/federation/bindings/tomcat/idp/AbstractIDPValve.java in PicketLink before 2.8.0.Beta1 does not properly check role based authorization, which allows remote authenticated users to gain access to restricted application resources via a (1) direct request or (2) request through an SP initiated flow.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the PicketLink Identity Provider Configuration (IDP) where, under specific conditions, the IDP ignores role-based authorization. This could lead to an authenticated user being able to access application resources that are not permitted for a given role.\n    "
