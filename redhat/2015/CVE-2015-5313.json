    "\nDirectory traversal vulnerability in the virStorageBackendFileSystemVolCreate function in storage/storage_backend_fs.c in libvirt, when fine-grained Access Control Lists (ACL) are in effect, allows local users with storage_vol:create ACL but not domain:write permission to write to arbitrary files via a ..

    "\nA path-traversal flaw was found in the way the libvirt daemon handled filesystem names for storage volumes. A libvirt user with privileges to create storage volumes and without privileges to create and modify domains could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges.\n    "
