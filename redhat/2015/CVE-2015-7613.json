    "\nRace condition in the IPC object implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.2.3 allows local users to gain privileges by triggering an ipc_addid call that leads to uid and gid comparisons against uninitialized data, related to msg.c, shm.c, and util.c.\n    ",
    "\nA race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPC subsystem initialized certain fields in an IPC object structure that were later used for permission checking before inserting the object into a globally visible list. A local, unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system.\n    "
