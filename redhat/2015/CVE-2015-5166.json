    "\nA flaw has been found in the QEMU emulator built with IDE Emulation PCI PIIX3/4 support; the emulator is vulnerable to a use-after-free flaw, while writing data to an I/O port inside a guest. This issue is specific to the Xen platform. A privileged(CAP_SYS_RAWIO) guest user on the Xen platform could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance or attempt to make a guest escape to QEMU-process privileges.\n    "
