  "details": [
    "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Web Console (web-console) in Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform before 6.4.4 and WildFly (formerly JBoss Application Server) before 2.0.0.CR9 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that make arbitrary changes to an instance via vectors involving a file upload using a multipart/form-data submission.",
    "It was discovered that when uploading a file using a multipart/form-data submission to the EAP Web Console, the Console was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This meant that an attacker could use the flaw together with a forgery attack to make changes to an authenticated instance."
