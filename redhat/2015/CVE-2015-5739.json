    "\nThe net/http library in net/textproto/reader.go in Go before 1.4.3 does not properly parse HTTP header keys, which allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks via a space instead of a hyphen, as demonstrated by \"Content Length\" instead of \"Content-Length.\"\n    ",
    "\nHTTP-request vulnerabilities have been found in the Golang net/http and net/textproto libraries. Request headers with double Content-Length fields do not generate a 400 error (the second field is ignored), and invalid fields are parsed as valid (for example, \"Content Length:\" with a space in the middle is accepted).  A non-authenticated attacker could exploit these flaws to bypass security controls, perform web-cache poisoning, or alter the request/response map (denial of service).\n    "
