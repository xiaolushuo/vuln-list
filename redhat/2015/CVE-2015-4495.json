    "\nA flaw was discovered in Mozilla Firefox that could be used to violate the same-origin policy and inject web script into a non-privileged part of the built-in PDF file viewer (PDF.js). An attacker could create a malicious web page that, when viewed by a victim, could steal arbitrary files (including private SSH keys, the /etc/passwd file, and other potentially sensitive files) from the system running Firefox.\n    "
