    "\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the CXGB3 kernel driver when the network was considered to be congested. The kernel incorrectly misinterpreted the congestion as an error condition and incorrectly freed or cleaned up the socket buffer (skb). When the device then sent the skb's queued data, these structures were referenced. A local attacker could use this flaw to panic the system (denial of service) or, with a local account, escalate their privileges.\n    "
