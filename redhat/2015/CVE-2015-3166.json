    "\nIt was discovered that PostgreSQL did not properly check the return values of certain standard library functions. If the system was in a state that would cause the standard library functions to fail (for example, memory exhaustion), an authenticated user could possibly exploit this flaw to disclose partial memory contents or cause the GSSAPI authentication to use an incorrect keytab file.\n    "
