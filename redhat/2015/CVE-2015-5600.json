  "details": [
    "\nThe kbdint_next_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH through 6.9 does not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactive devices within a single connection, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long and duplicative list in the ssh -oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified client that provides a different password for each pam element on this list.\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that the OpenSSH sshd daemon did not check the list of keyboard-interactive authentication methods for duplicates. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass the MaxAuthTries limit, making it easier to perform password guessing attacks.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nThis issue can be mitigated by disabling keyboard-interactive authentication method.  That can be achieved by setting \"ChallengeResponseAuthentication no\" in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config configuration file and restarting the sshd service.\n    ",
