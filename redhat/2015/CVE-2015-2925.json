    "\nThe prepend_path function in fs/dcache.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2.4 does not properly handle rename actions inside a bind mount, which allows local users to bypass an intended container protection mechanism by renaming a directory, related to a \"double-chroot attack.\"\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's file system implementation handled rename operations in which the source was inside and the destination was outside of a bind mount. A privileged user inside a container could use this flaw to escape the bind mount and, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.\n    "
