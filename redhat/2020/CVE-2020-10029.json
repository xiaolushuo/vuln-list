  "statement": "The glibc version shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is compiled using gcc's stack-protector option which mitigates the possibility of code execution led by the stack corruption.\nThe glibc version shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is more difficult to exploit using this flaw, specifically for remote code execution. Because exploitation of the flaw depends on the usage of pseudo-zero values, an attacker can only overwrite the stack with 0s. Due to this, a valid address value for code execution is difficult to get and is likely to only result in a crash.",

  "name": "CVE-2020-10029",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.32 could overflow an on-stack buffer during range reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a 0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.",
    "A flaw was found in glibc in versions prior to 2.32. Pseudo-zero values are not validated causing a stack corruption due to a stack-based overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
