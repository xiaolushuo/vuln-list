  "statement": "The glibc version shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is compiled using gcc's stack-protector option which mitigates the possibility of code execution led by the stack corruption.\nFor Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the severity rating is Moderate due to the difficulty to exploit. Specifically for remote code execution, since exploiting the flaw depends on the usage of pseudo-zero values, constructing  such a value with a valid memory address embedded is very unlikely to be made. See bugzilla 1810670 comment #12 for more details. An attempt to exploit it would overwrite the return address value stored in the stack with an invalid value address, resulting most of the time in DoS.",

  "details": [
    "The GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.32 could overflow an on-stack buffer during range reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a 0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.",
    "A flaw was found in the __ieee754_rem_pio2l() function of glibc. The __ieee754_rem_pio2l() function does not validate pseudo-zero values, causing a stack corruption due to a stack-based overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
