  "mitigation": "A possible workaround for this flaw is to configure IPsec for all traffic between the endpoints, instead of specifically for the UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnels. If GENEVE tunnels are not used, this flaw will not be triggered. In that case, it is possible to disable those tunnels, by unloading the \"geneve\" kernel module and blacklisting it (See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 for a\nguide on how to blacklist modules).",
