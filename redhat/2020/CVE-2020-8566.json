  "mitigation": "OCP Clusters not using Ceph RBD volumes are not vulnerable to this issue. For clusters using Ceph RBD volumes, this can be mitigated by ensuring the logging level is below 4 and protecting unauthorized access to cluster logs.\nFor OCP, the logging level for core components can be configured using operators, e.g. for kube-controller-manager:\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/rest_api/operator_apis/kubecontrollermanager-operator-openshift-io-v1.html#specification\nIn OCP, a logging level of \"Debug\" is equivalent to 4: \nhttps://github.com/openshift/api/blob/master/operator/v1/types.go#L96\nThe default logging level is \"Normal\", which is equivalent to 2. Clusters running with the default level are not vulnerable to this issue.",
