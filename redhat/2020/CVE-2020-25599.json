  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Xen. Uses of EVTCHNOP_reset or XEN_DOMCTL_soft_reset can lead to the violation of various internal assumptions leading to an out of bounds memory access or triggering of bug checks. In particular x86 PV guests may be able to elevate their privilege to that of the host. Information leaks cannot be ruled out and host and guest crashes are also possible, leading to a denial of service (DoS). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
