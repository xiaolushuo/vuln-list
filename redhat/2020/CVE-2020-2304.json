    "A flaw was found in the subversion Jenkins plugin. The XML parser is not properly configured to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks allowing an attacker the ability to control an agent process and have Jenkins parse a crafted changelog file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
