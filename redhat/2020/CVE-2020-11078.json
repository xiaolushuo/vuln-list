  "statement": "While Red Hat Quay 3.0, and 3.1 used the httplib2 library it was removed in versions 3.2 and later. Upgrade to 3.2 or later to fix this vulnerability in Red Hat Quay.\nRed Hat Gluster Storage 3 delivers the affected version of the python-httplib2 library. However the library is not used by Gluster hence the impact by this vulnerability is low.\nThis issue affects the version of the python-httplib2 library as shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) version 2. Ceph-2 has reached End of Extended Life Cycle Support and no longer fixing moderates/lows.\nThere's currently no known vector to exploit this when using Python versions with CVE-2019-9740 and CVE-2019-9947 fixed.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In httplib2 before version 0.18.0, an attacker controlling unescaped part of uri for `httplib2.Http.request()` could change request headers and body, send additional hidden requests to same server. This vulnerability impacts software that uses httplib2 with uri constructed by string concatenation, as opposed to proper urllib building with escaping. This has been fixed in 0.18.0."
