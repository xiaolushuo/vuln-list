Use of telnetd is not recommended, as it is an un-encrypted protocol with cleartext transmission of passwords; alternatives such as openssh are preferred.",

  "details": [
    "utility.c in telnetd in netkit telnet through 0.17 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via short writes or urgent data, because of a buffer overflow involving the netclear and nextitem functions.",
    "A vulnerability was found where incorrect bounds checks in the telnet server’s (telnetd) handling of short writes and urgent data, could lead to information disclosure and corruption of heap data. An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit these bugs by sending specially crafted telnet packets to achieve arbitrary code execution in the telnet server."
