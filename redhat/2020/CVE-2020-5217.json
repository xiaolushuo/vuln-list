  "statement": "Satellite 6 ships Secure Header rubygem, however, it does not accept any user input in override_content_security_policy_directive or append_content_security_policy_directive. All directives are hard-coded and therefor Satellite 6 is not vulnerable to this CVE. We may update this rubygem in future release.",

  "name": "CVE-2020-5217",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Secure Headers (RubyGem secure_headers), a directive injection vulnerability is present in versions before 3.8.0, 5.1.0, and 6.2.0. If user-supplied input was passed into append/override_content_security_policy_directives, a semicolon could be injected leading to directive injection. This could be used to e.g. override a script-src directive. Duplicate directives are ignored and the first one wins. The directives in secure_headers are sorted alphabetically so they pretty much all come before script-src. A previously undefined directive would receive a value even if SecureHeaders::OPT_OUT was supplied. The fixed versions will silently convert the semicolons to spaces and emit a deprecation warning when this happens. This will result in innocuous browser console messages if being exploited/accidentally used. In future releases, we will raise application errors resulting in 500s. Depending on what major version you are using, the fixed versions are 6.2.0, 5.1.0, 3.8.0."
