  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A race condition flaw was found in Xen. When migrating timers of x86 HVM guests between its vCPUs, the locking model that is used allows for a second vCPU of the same guest that is also operating on the timers, to release a lock that was not acquired. The issue leads to the hypervisor hanging or crashing, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
