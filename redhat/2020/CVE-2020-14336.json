  "statement": "By default, the OpenShift Container Platform uses the OpenShift SDN network interface. This interface makes this attack impractical by implementing IPTable rules on the host side of the virtual network interface, isolating network traffic to within the pod.\nIf the OpenShift Container Platform has the sriov-network-operator deployed, it is at a greater risk for exploitation.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the Restricted Security Context Constraints (SCC), where it allows pods to craft custom network packets. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service attack on an OpenShift Container Platform cluster if they can deploy pods. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
