    "Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the upstream job's display name shown as part of a build cause, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.",
    "A flaw was found in Jenkins versions 2.244 and prior and in LTS 2.235.1 and prior. The upstream job's display name is not escaped on build time trend pages which could lead to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The user must have the Agent/Configure permission for this exploit to function. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
