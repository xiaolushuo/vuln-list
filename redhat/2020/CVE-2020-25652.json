  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the spice-vdagentd daemon, where it did not properly handle client connections that can be established via the UNIX domain socket in `/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock`. Any unprivileged local guest user could use this flaw to prevent legitimate agents from connecting to the spice-vdagentd daemon, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. This flaw affects spice-vdagent versions 0.20 and prior."
