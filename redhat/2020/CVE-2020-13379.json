    "The avatar feature in Grafana 3.0.1 through 7.0.1 has an SSRF Incorrect Access Control issue. This vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user/client to make Grafana send HTTP requests to any URL and return its result to the user/client. This can be used to gain information about the network that Grafana is running on. Furthermore, passing invalid URL objects could be used for DOS'ing Grafana via SegFault.",
    "An SSRF incorrect access control vulnerability was found in Grafana regarding the avatar feature, allowing any unauthenticated user or client to make Grafana send HTTP requests to any URL and then return its result to the user or client. Additionally, the same issue can create a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to gain information about the network that Grafana is running on, or cause a segmentation fault, resulting in a denial of service."
