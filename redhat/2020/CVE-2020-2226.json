User names are not escaped in the permission table which could lead to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The user must have the Agent/Configure, Job/Configure, or Overall/Administer permissions for this exploit to function. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
