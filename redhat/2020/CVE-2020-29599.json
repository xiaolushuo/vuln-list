    "ImageMagick before 6.9.11-40 and 7.x before 7.0.10-40 mishandles the -authenticate option, which allows setting a password for password-protected PDF files. The user-controlled password was not properly escaped/sanitized and it was therefore possible to inject additional shell commands via coders/pdf.c.",
    "A flaw was found in ImageMagick. The -authenticate option is mishandled allowing user-controlled password set for a PDF file to possibly inject additional shell commands via coders/pdf.c. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
