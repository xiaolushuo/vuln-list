  "details": [
    "The file name encoding algorithm used internally in Apache Commons Compress 1.15 to 1.18 can get into an infinite loop when faced with specially crafted inputs. This can lead to a denial of service attack if an attacker can choose the file names inside of an archive created by Compress.",
    "A resource consumption vulnerability was discovered in apache-commons-compress in the way NioZipEncoding encodes filenames. Applications that use Compress to create archives, with one of the filenames within the archive being controlled by the user, may be vulnerable to this flaw. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause an infinite loop during the archive creation, thus leading to a denial of service."
