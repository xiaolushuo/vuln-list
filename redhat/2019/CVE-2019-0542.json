  "statement": "This issue affects both the atomic-openshift-web-console RPM and openshift3/ose-console container image shipped in OpenShift Container Platform. These components provide a web console for opening in-browser terminals in cluster pods. Successful exploitation of this issue would require an attacker to convince an authorized user to open an in-browser terminal on a target pod and execute a command that prints attacker-controlled input. Red Hat Product Security have rated this issue as having security impact of Moderate. A future update may address this issue.",

An attacker could exploit this by convincing a user with a xterm.js browser terminal to display an escape sequence by, for example, reading a from a log file containing attacker-controlled input."
