    "There is a DoS vulnerability in Pillow before 6.2.2 caused by FpxImagePlugin.py calling the range function on an unvalidated 32-bit integer if the number of bands is large. On Windows running 32-bit Python, this results in an OverflowError or MemoryError due to the 2 GB limit. However, on Linux running 64-bit Python this results in the process being terminated by the OOM killer.",
    "A denial of service vulnerability was found in Pillow in versions before 6.2.2, where the FpxImagePlugin.py file calls the range function on an unvalidated 32-bit integer if the number of bands is large. On Windows systems running 32-bit Python, this flaw results in an OverflowError or MemoryError due to the 2 GB limit. On Linux systems running 64-bit Python, this flaw results in the termination of the process by the out-of-memory (OOM) killer. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
