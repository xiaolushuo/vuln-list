    "A vulnerability was found in all pki-core 10.x.x version, where the Token Processing Service (TPS) did not properly sanitize several parameters stored for the tokens, possibly resulting in a Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker able to modify the parameters of any token could use this flaw to trick an authenticated user into executing arbitrary JavaScript code.",
