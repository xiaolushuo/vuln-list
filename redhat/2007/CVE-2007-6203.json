    "\nApache HTTP Server 2.0.x and 2.2.x does not sanitize the HTTP Method specifier header from an HTTP request when it is reflected back in a \"413 Request Entity Too Large\" error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS) style attacks using web client components that can send arbitrary headers in requests, as demonstrated via an HTTP request containing an invalid Content-length value, a similar issue to CVE-2006-3918.\n    "

In order to exploit this for cross-site scripting, the attacker would have to get the victim to supply an arbitrary malformed HTTP method to a target site.
