  "details": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow in the CRC32 verification in Info-ZIP UnZip 6.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted zip file in the -t command argument to the unzip command.",
    "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way unzip computed the CRC32 checksum of certain extra fields of a file. A specially crafted Zip archive could cause unzip to crash when the archive was tested with unzip's '-t' option."
