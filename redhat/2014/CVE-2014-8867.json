  "details": [
    "\nThe acceleration support for the \"REP MOVS\" instruction in Xen 4.4.x, 3.2.x, and earlier lacks properly bounds checking for memory mapped I/O (MMIO) emulated in the hypervisor, which allows local HVM guests to cause a denial of service (host crash) via unspecified vectors.\n    ",
    "\nAn insufficient bound checking flaw was found in the Xen hypervisor's implementation of acceleration support for the \"REP MOVS\" instructions. A privileged HVM guest user could potentially use this flaw to crash the host.\n    "
