    "\nOpenStack Identity (Keystone) before 2013.2.4, 2014.1 before 2014.1.2, and Juno before Juno-2 does not properly handle chained delegation, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges by leveraging a (1) trust or (2) OAuth token with impersonation enabled to create a new token with additional roles.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in keystone's chained delegation. A trustee able to create a delegation from a trust or an OAuth token could misuse identity impersonation to bypass the enforced scope, possibly allowing them to obtain elevated privileges to the trustor's projects and roles.\n    "
