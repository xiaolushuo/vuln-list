    "\nA side-channel timing attack flaw was found in Nova. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to guess valid instance ID signatures, giving them access to details of another instance, by analyzing the response times of requests for instance metadata. This issue only affected configurations that proxy metadata requests via Neutron.\n    "
