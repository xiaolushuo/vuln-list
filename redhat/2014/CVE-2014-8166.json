  "details": [
    "\nThe browsing feature in the server in CUPS does not filter ANSI escape sequences from shared printer names, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted printer name.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the way the CUPS daemon added shared printers announced through the network. A malicious host or user could send a specially crafted UDP packet to a CUPS server that, when processed, could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the CUPS daemon.\n    "
