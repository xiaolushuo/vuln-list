    "The xmlParserHandlePEReference function in parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.2, as used in Web Listener in Oracle HTTP Server in Oracle Fusion Middleware 11.1.1.7.0, 12.1.2.0, and 12.1.3.0 and other products, loads external parameter entities regardless of whether entity substitution or validation is enabled, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a crafted XML document.",
    "It was discovered that libxml2 loaded external parameter entities even when entity substitution was disabled. A remote attacker able to provide a specially crafted XML file to an application linked against libxml2 could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, possibly resulting in a denial of service or an information leak on the system."
