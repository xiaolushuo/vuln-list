    "\nA certain Red Hat patch for net/ipv4/route.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.18 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via crafted packets that force collisions in the IPv4 routing hash table, and trigger a routing \"emergency\" in which a hash chain is too long.  NOTE: this is related to an issue in the Linux kernel before 2.6.31, when the kernel routing cache is disabled, involving an uninitialized pointer and a panic.\n    "
