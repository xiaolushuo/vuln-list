  "details": [
    "\nThe ABI in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 and earlier on s390, powerpc, sparc64, and mips 64-bit platforms requires that a 32-bit argument in a 64-bit register was properly sign extended when sent from a user-mode application, but cannot verify this, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted system call.\n    "

  "statement": "\nThis flaw affects most 64-bit architectures, including IBM S/390 and 64-bit PowerPC, but it does not affect x86_64 or Intel Itanium. The risks associated with fixing this flaw are greater than the security risk. We therefore currently have no plans to fix this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, or 5. Red Hat Enterprise MRG is not affected as it is not supported on 64-bit architectures other than x86_64.\n    ",
