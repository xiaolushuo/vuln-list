    "\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Apache2 component of PHP was found. When using 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked', the request allows remote attackers to potentially run a malicious script in a victim's browser. This vulnerability can be exploited only by producing malformed requests and it's believed it's unlikely to be used in practical cross-site scripting attack.\n    "
