    "source-to-image component of Openshift Container Platform before versions atomic-openshift 3.7.53, atomic-openshift 3.9.31 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation which allows the assemble script to run as the root user in a non-privileged container. An attacker can use this flaw to open network connections, and possibly other actions, on the host which are normally only available to a root user.",
