  "statement": "HTTP/2 support was added to haproxy in version 1.8, therefore OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.7 and earlier are unaffected by this flaw, see [1]. OCP 3.11 added a configuration option to ose-haproxy-router that made enabling HTTP/2 support easy, [2]. Prior to that, in versions OCP 3.9 and 3.10, an administrator had to customize the haproxy router configuration to add HTTP/2 support, [3]. OCP 3.9, and 3.10 are rated as moderate because HTTP/2 support was not a standard configuration option, and therefore unlikely to be enabled.\nVersions of haproxy included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, excluding rh-haproxy18-haproxy in Red Hat Software Collections, are unaffected as they package versions of haproxy before 1.7.\n[1] http://www.haproxy.org/news.html\n[2] https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/19968\n[3] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/install_config/router/customized_haproxy_router.html",

  "name": "CVE-2018-20615",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An out-of-bounds read issue was discovered in the HTTP/2 protocol decoder in HAProxy 1.8.x and 1.9.x through 1.9.0 which can result in a crash. The processing of the PRIORITY flag in a HEADERS frame requires 5 extra bytes, and while these bytes are skipped, the total frame length was not re-checked to make sure they were present in the frame.",
    "A flaw was found in HAProxy, versions before 1.8.17 and 1.9.1. Mishandling occurs when a priority flag is set on too short HEADERS frame in the HTTP/2 decoder, allowing an out-of-bounds read and a subsequent crash to occur. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. Those who do not use HTTP/2 are unaffected."
