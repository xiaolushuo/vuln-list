  "details": [
    "\nSamba from version 4.0.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7, 4.9.3 is vulnerable to a denial of service. During the processing of an LDAP search before Samba's AD DC returns the LDAP entries to the client, the entries are cached in a single memory object with a maximum size of 256MB. When this size is reached, the Samba process providing the LDAP service will follow the NULL pointer, terminating the process. There is no further vulnerability associated with this issue, merely a denial of service.\n    ",
    "\nA null pointer dereference was found in the way LDAP search was implemented when Samba is used as Active Directory Domain Controller. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash).\n    "
