However, as this is an issue in a unit test, it is not a problem if you are using the precompiled gimp package. This is only a problem if you recompile gimp using the src.rpm/SPEC file. Even then it's only a problem if you do not make use of isolating build tools like mock, but instead use rpmbuild directly.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (gimp):\nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release.

    "\nGIMP through 2.10.2 makes g_get_tmp_dir calls to establish temporary filenames, which may result in a filename that already exists, as demonstrated by the gimp_write_and_read_file function in app/tests/test-xcf.c. This might be leveraged by attackers to overwrite files or read file content that was intended to be private.\n    "
