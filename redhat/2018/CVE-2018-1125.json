  "details": [
    "\nprocps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow in pgrep. This vulnerability is mitigated by FORTIFY, as it involves strncat() to a stack-allocated string. When pgrep is compiled with FORTIFY (as on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora), the impact is limited to a crash.\n    ",
    "\nIf a process inspected by pgrep has an argument longer than INT_MAX bytes, \"int bytes\" could wrap around back to a large positive int (rather than approaching zero), leading to a stack buffer overflow via strncat().\n    "
