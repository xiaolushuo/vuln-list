  "details": [
    "\nOn a Samba 4 AD DC the LDAP server in all versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards incorrectly validates permissions to modify passwords over LDAP allowing authenticated users to change any other users' passwords, including administrative users and privileged service accounts (eg Domain Controllers).\n    ",

  ],
  "mitigation": "\nRevoke the change passwords right for everyone from all user objects (including computers) in the directory. Note that this will prevent users from being able to change their own expired passwords, so the maximum password age should be set to a value that prevents user passwords from expiring while the workaround is in place.
