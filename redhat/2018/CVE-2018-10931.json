  "details": [
    "\nIt was found that cobbler 2.6.x exposed all functions from its CobblerXMLRPCInterface class over XMLRPC. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to gain high privileges within cobbler, upload files to arbitrary location in the context of the daemon.\n    ",
    "\nAn API-exposure flaw was found in cobbler, where it exported CobblerXMLRPCInterface private functions over XMLRPC. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to gain important privileges within cobbler, as well as upload files to an arbitrary location in the daemon context.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nIf SELinux is enabled, it might prevent some locations from accepting uploaded files from the attacker. This prevents some basic attacks allowing remote code execution, although it would not exclude all other possibilities.\n    ",
