This flaw may lead to an integer underflow that can be used to produce an heap-based buffer overflow. A malicious host on the same network segment as the victim's one may advertise itself as a DHCPv6 server and exploit this flaw to cause a Denial of Service or potentially gain code execution on the victim's machine.\n    "
