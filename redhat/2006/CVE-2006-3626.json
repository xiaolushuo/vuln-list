  "statement": "\nThis vulnerability does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 or 3 as they are based on 2.4 kernels.\n\nThe exploit relies on the kernel supporting the a.out binary format.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Fedora Core 4, and Fedora Core 5 do not support the a.out binary format, causing the exploit to fail.  We are not currently aware of any way to exploit this vulnerability if a.out binary format is not enabled.  In addition, a default installation of these OS enables SELinux in enforcing mode.  SELinux also completely blocks attempts to exploit this issue.\n\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=198973#c10\n    ",
