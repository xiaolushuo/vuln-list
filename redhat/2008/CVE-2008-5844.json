  "details": [
    "\nPHP 5.2.7 contains an incorrect change to the FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW functionality, and unintentionally disables magic_quotes_gpc regardless of the actual magic_quotes_gpc setting, which might make it easier for context-dependent attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks and unspecified other attacks.\n    "
