  "details": [
    "\nThe dba_replace function in PHP 5.2.6 and 4.x allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (file truncation) via a key with the NULL byte.  NOTE: this might only be a vulnerability in limited circumstances in which the attacker can modify or add database entries but does not have permissions to truncate the file.\n    "

  "statement": "\nThis is not a security issue. A user with read and write access to a file can reasonably be expected to manipulate the contents of the file, including truncating it. Instead of using dba_replace(), a user could simply fopen() the file in write mode, which provides the same end-result.\n    ",
