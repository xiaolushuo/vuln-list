    "\nThe mkdir procedure of GNU Guile temporarily changed the process' umask to zero. During that time window, in a multithreaded application, other threads could end up creating files with insecure permissions. For example, mkdir without the optional mode argument would create directories as 0777. This is fixed in Guile 2.0.13. Prior versions are affected.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was found in guile, in the mkdir procedure's usage of umask(2). Under particular circumstances, an attacker could influence an application written in guile to create directories or files insecurely, potentially exposing them to being read or manipulated by local users.\n    "
