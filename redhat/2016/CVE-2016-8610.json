  "statement": "\nThis flaw affects applications that are compiled against OpenSSL or GnuTLS and do not allocate an extra thread for processing ClientHello messages. Nginx is affected by this issue; Apache httpd is not affected by this issue. This issue has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. It requires an attacker to send a very large amount of SSL ALERT messages to the host network connection. This issue can also be mitigated by configuring firewalls to limit the number of connections per IP address, or use deep packet inspection to reject these type of alert packets. A future update may address this issue.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate.
