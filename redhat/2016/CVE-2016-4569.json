    "\nThe snd_timer_user_params function in sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6 does not initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via crafted use of the ALSA timer interface.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was found in Linux kernel. There is an information leak in file \"sound/core/timer.c\" of the latest mainline Linux kernel, the stack object “tread” has a total size of 32 bytes. It contains a 8-bytes padding, which is not initialized but sent to user via copy_to_user(), resulting a kernel leak.\n    "
