    "\nThe resolver in nginx before 1.8.1 and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and worker process crash) via a crafted UDP DNS response.\n    ",

An attacker able to manipulate DNS responses received by nginx could use this flaw to cause a worker process to crash if nginx enabled the resolver in its configuration.\n    "
