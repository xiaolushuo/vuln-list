    "\nA DOM-based, cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the OpenStack dashboard, where user input was not filtered correctly. An authenticated dashboard user could exploit the flaw by injecting an AngularJS template into a dashboard form (for example, using an image's description), triggering the vulnerability when another user browsed the affected page. As a result, this flaw could result in user accounts being compromised (for example, user-access credentials being stolen).\n    "
