  "statement": "\nIt seems that this flaw is not practically exploitable, the leak of host private key material to the privilege-separated child processes is theoretical. No such leak was observed in practice for normal-sized keys, nor does a leak to the child processes directly expose key material to unprivileged users. Because of the this restriction for successful exploitation, this issue has been rated as having Low security impact. A future update may address this flaw.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 4: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release. Please contact Red Hat Support for further information.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low.
