  "acknowledgement": "This issue was discovered by Richard Opalka and Arun Neelicattu of Red Hat.",
  "name": "CVE-2013-2133",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The EJB invocation handler implementation in Red Hat JBossWS, as used in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) before 6.2.0, does not properly enforce the method level restrictions for JAX-WS Service endpoints, which allows remote authenticated users to access otherwise restricted JAX-WS handlers by leveraging permissions to the EJB class.",
    "A flaw was found in the way method-level authorization for JAX-WS Service endpoints was performed by the EJB invocation handler implementation. Any restrictions declared on EJB methods were ignored when executing the JAX-WS handlers, and only class-level restrictions were applied. A remote attacker who is authorized to access the EJB class, could invoke a JAX-WS handler which they were not authorized to invoke."
