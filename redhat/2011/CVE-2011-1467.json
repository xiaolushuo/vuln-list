  "statement": "\nThis issue did not affect the versions of PHP as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  The getSymbol() and setSymbol() functions are unlikely to ever receive untrusted input as an $attr argument, and it is even less likely that they would receive such input when only a small set of pre-defined constants is expected.  As a result, this flaw can only be triggered by the script author and cannot be used to cross trust boundaries. The Red Hat Security Response Team does not consider it to be security-relevant.\n    ",
