A future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.  To mitigate this issue, users should ensure that confirmation is requested on each inbound connection attempt, that a password is required to connect, and that automatic network configuration is disabled.  This will prevent vino from using UPnP to allow access to the VNC port, and will ensure that any connections require a password and that the user is notified on any connection attempts.\n    ",
