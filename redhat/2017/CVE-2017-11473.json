For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n\nThis attack requires \n\n- An attacker to be able to write to the ACPI tables ( local, privileged operation and non generalized attacks)\n- The ability for the attacker to reboot the system  ( local, privileged operation )\n- The ACPI table changes to persist through reboots  ( not common on cloud/serverless platforms )\n- This modification to the table alone is able to possibly corrupt memory, but the corruption will not be enough alone, the corrupted affected memory will be overwritten with valid acpi struct data which also has to corrupt the memory in which a way the flaw can create abuse (HARD).\n- The attacker will find it significantly difficult to abuse this a flaw in early-boot as injecting code/controlled execution at this point would require privileges.  If an attacker had this specific privilege, there are easier ways to gain privilege escalation.\n    ",
