  "details": [
    "\nA vulnerability was found in openstack-cinder releases up to and including Queens, allowing newly created volumes in certain storage volume configurations to contain previous data. It specifically affects ScaleIO volumes using thin volumes and zero padding. This could lead to leakage of sensitive information between tenants.\n    ",
    "\nAn information-leak flaw was found in openstack-cinder deployments using the third-party EMC ScaleIO backend. It was possible for new volumes to contain previous data if they were created from storage pools which had disabled zero-padding. An attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information.\n    "
