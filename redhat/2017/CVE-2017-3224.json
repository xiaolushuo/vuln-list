  "details": [
    "\nOpen Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol implementations may improperly determine Link State Advertisement (LSA) recency for LSAs with MaxSequenceNumber. According to RFC 2328 section 13.1, for two instances of the same LSA, recency is determined by first comparing sequence numbers, then checksums, and finally MaxAge. In a case where the sequence numbers are the same, the LSA with the larger checksum is considered more recent, and will not be flushed from the Link State Database (LSDB). Since the RFC does not explicitly state that the values of links carried by a LSA must be the same when prematurely aging a self-originating LSA with MaxSequenceNumber, it is possible in vulnerable OSPF implementations for an attacker to craft a LSA with MaxSequenceNumber and invalid links that will result in a larger checksum and thus a 'newer' LSA that will not be flushed from the LSDB. Propagation of the crafted LSA can result in the erasure or alteration of the routing tables of routers within the routing domain, creating a denial of service condition or the re-routing of traffic on the network. CVE-2017-3224 has been reserved for Quagga and downstream implementations (SUSE, openSUSE, and Red Hat packages).\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was discovered in several OSPF implementations, including Quagga. A malicious OSPF peer, or an attacker able to spoof messages from an OSPF peer, could send a crafted message that would result in erasure or alteration of the routing table, resulting in denial of service or incorrect routing of traffic.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nIt is strongly recommended to configure Quagga to require authentication from OSPF peers (eg `ip ospf authentication message-digest `).  Message digest authentication effectively prevents even a man-in-the-middle attacker from exploiting this vulnerability or otherwise interfering with the routing table, as any message without a proper cryptographic signature will be rejected.\n    ",
