    "\nThe shadow-paging feature in Xen through 4.8.x mismanages page references and consequently introduces a race condition, which allows guest OS users to obtain Xen privileges, aka XSA-219.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nWhere the HVM guest is explicitly configured to use shadow paging (eg\nvia the `hap=0' xl domain configuration file parameter), changing to\nHAP (eg by setting `hap=1') will avoid exposing the vulnerability to\nthose guests.  HAP is the default (in upstream Xen), where the\nhardware supports it; so this mitigation is only applicable if HAP has\nbeen disabled by configuration.\n\n(This mitigation is not applicable to PV guests.)\n    ",
