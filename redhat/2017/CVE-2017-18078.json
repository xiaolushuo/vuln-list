    "\nsystemd-tmpfiles in systemd before 237 attempts to support ownership/permission changes on hardlinked files even if the fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl is turned off, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions via vectors involving a hard link to a file for which the user lacks write access, as demonstrated by changing the ownership of the /etc/passwd file.\n    "

These protections are enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and this vulnerability will only be exploitable if disabled.\n\nTo ensure your system is protected, check that `fs.protected_hardlinks` is enabled as in the following example:\n\n  # sysctl fs.protected_hardlinks\n  fs.protected_hardlinks = 1\n    ",
