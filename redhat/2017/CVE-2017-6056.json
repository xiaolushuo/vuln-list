  "statement": "This issue was made easier to exploit, causing a denial of service when the patch for CVE-2016-6816 was present and the patch that corrected this flaw was not.  The issue was not classified as a security flaw upstream.  It was corrected in products like Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 and JBoss Enterprise Web Server 3 prior to the fix for CVE-2016-6816 being applied.  This was not the case for JBoss Enterprise Application Server 6.  As a result, only EAP 6.4.13 is vulnerable to this issue and 6.4.14 corrects it.  For further information, refer to https://access.redhat.com/articles/2991951",

  "details": [
    "It was discovered that a programming error in the processing of HTTPS requests in the Apache Tomcat servlet and JSP engine may result in denial of service via an infinite loop. The denial of service is easily achievable as a consequence of backporting a CVE-2016-6816 fix but not backporting the fix for Tomcat bug 57544. Distributions affected by this backporting issue include Debian (before 7.0.56-3+deb8u8 and 8.0.14-1+deb8u7 in jessie) and Ubuntu.",
