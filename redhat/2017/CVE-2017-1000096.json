  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Arbitrary code execution due to incomplete sandbox protection: Constructors, instance variable initializers, and instance initializers in Pipeline scripts were not subject to sandbox protection, and could therefore execute arbitrary code. This could be exploited e.g. by regular Jenkins users with the permission to configure Pipelines in Jenkins, or by trusted committers to repositories containing Jenkinsfiles.",
    "The jenkins-plugin-script-security has incomplete sandbox protection which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via constructors, instance variable initializers, and instance initializers in Pipeline scripts. Exploitation of this requires the attacker to have permission to configure Pipelines in Jenkins or be a trusted committers to repositories containing Jenkinsfiles and for that Jenkins instance to be hosting other projects as well that the attacker should not have access to."
