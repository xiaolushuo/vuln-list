  "details": [
    "\nThe bnep_add_connection function in net/bluetooth/bnep/core.c in the Linux kernel before 3.19 does not ensure that an l2cap socket is available, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type of second socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(), which could lead to memory corruption. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we feel it is unlikely.\n    "
