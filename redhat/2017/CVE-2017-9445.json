    "\nIn systemd through 233, certain sizes passed to dns_packet_new in systemd-resolved can cause it to allocate a buffer that's too small. A malicious DNS server can exploit this via a response with a specially crafted TCP payload to trick systemd-resolved into allocating a buffer that's too small, and subsequently write arbitrary data beyond the end of it.\n    ",
    "\nAn out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way systemd-resolved daemon handled processing of DNS responses. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash the daemon or execute arbitrary code in the context of the daemon process.\n    "
