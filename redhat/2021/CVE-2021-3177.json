  "details": [
    "Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.",
    "A flaw was found in python. A stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in the ctypes module provided within Python. Applications that use ctypes without carefully validating the input passed to it may be vulnerable to this flaw, which would allow an attacker to overflow a buffer on the stack and potentially execute code on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
