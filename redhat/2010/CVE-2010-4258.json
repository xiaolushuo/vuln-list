  "statement": "\nThe Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG enabled the panic_on_oops sysctl tunable by default, and therefore are not affected by this issue. However, as a preventive measure (for example, for administrators who have turned panic_on_oops off), this issue was fixed in kernel updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG. Because the fix was considered as a preventative measure, this CVE is not listed in the related advisories that provided the fix: RHSA-2011:0162, RHSA-2011:0263, RHSA-2011:0017, RHSA-2011:0498, RHSA-2011:0542, RHSA-2011:0330. The fix is documented in each of these advisories as a regular bug fix, for example as BZ#659568 in RHSA-2011:0162.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 4: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate.
