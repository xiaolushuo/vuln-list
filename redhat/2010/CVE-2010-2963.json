  "statement": "\nThis issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 as they did not include the upstream commit eb4eeccc that introduced the problem. It did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not provide support for the Stradis driver that uses the vulnerable compat code for VIDIOCSMICROCODE. As a preventive measure, we have removed the vulnerable code in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0839.html. We plan to remove the vulnerable code in a future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise MRG.\n    ",
