  "statement": "The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is not vulnerable because it checks for mmap_min_addr even in special cases.\nThe Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG have mmap_min_addr sysctl tunable set to 4096, and therefore are not affected by this issue. However, as a preventive measure (for example, for administrators who have increased mmap_min_addr), we have addressed this in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and MRG via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0429.html, https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0421.html, and https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0330.html.",

    "The install_special_mapping function in mm/mmap.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37-rc6 does not make an expected security_file_mmap function call, which allows local users to bypass intended mmap_min_addr restrictions and possibly conduct NULL pointer dereference attacks via a crafted assembly-language application."
