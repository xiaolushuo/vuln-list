In order for the crash condition to be observed, the RADIUS server must already be unresponsive for extended periods of time, the net result of which is that you cannot DoS an already-unresponsive server.  Other specialized conditions are required as well, that make an attack using this flaw unviable.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release. Please contact Red Hat Support for further information.\n    ",
