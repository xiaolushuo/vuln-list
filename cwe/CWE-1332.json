 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "Fault Injection is a technique used by adversaries to\n                    alter the operating conditions of hardware so that\n                    unexpected behavior occurs. Generally, this is accomplished by causing the\n                    device to operate outside of its expected conditions or by\n                    inducing electrical disturbances in the device. A weakness\n                    may arise in systems that do not properly protect\n                    against common fault injection techniques targeting the\n                    skipping of security critical instructions.",
  "In practice, application code may contain conditional\n                    branches that are security-sensitive (e.g., \n                    accepting or rejecting a user-provided password. These\n                    conditional branches are typically implemented by a single\n                    conditional branch instruction in the program binary\n                    which, if skipped through fault injection, may lead to\n                    flipping the branch condition - i.e., causing the wrong\n\t\t\t\t\tsecurity-sensitive branch to be taken. This affects processes such\n                    as firmware authentication, password verification, and\n                    other security-sensitive decision points."
