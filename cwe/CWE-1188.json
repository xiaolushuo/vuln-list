 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "Developers often choose default values that leave the software as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value.  However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it."
