 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "It is common for software to access peripherals in an SoC through a memory-mapped register interface.  Any security-critical data accessible directly or indirectly through the register interface must have a clearly defined access control policy which is correctly implemented to protect assets in the hardware design from software."
