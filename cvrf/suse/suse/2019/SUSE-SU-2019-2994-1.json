SES customers were never exposed to this\n  regression (bsc#1132767).\n\n- Fixed a denial of service vulnerability where an unauthenticated client of\n  Ceph Object Gateway could trigger a crash from an uncaught exception\n  (bsc#1145093, CVE-2019-10222)\n\n- Nautilus-based librbd clients could not open images on Jewel clusters\n  (bsc#1151994).\n\n- The RGW num_rados_handles has been removed (bsc#1151995).\n\n- \u0026quot;osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_key_threshold\u0026quot; has been lowered in Nautilus\n  (bsc#1152002).\n\n- The ceph dashboard now supports silencing Prometheus notifications\n  (bsc#1141174).\n\n- The no{up,down,in,out} related commands have been revamped (bsc#1151990).\n\n- Radosgw-admin got two new subcommands for managing expire-stale objects\n  (bsc#1151991)..\n\n- Deploying a single new BlueStore OSD on a cluster upgraded to SES6 from SES5\n  used to break pool utilization stats reported by ceph df (bsc#1151992).\n\n- Ceph clusters will issue a health warning if CRUSH tunables are older than\n  \u0026quot;hammer\u0026quot; (bsc#1151993).\n\n- Ceph-volume prints errors to stdout with --format json (bsc#1132767).\n\n- Changing rgw-api-host in the dashboard does not get effective without\n  disable/enable dashboard mgr module (bsc#1137503).\n\n- Silenced Alertmanager alerts in the dashboard (bsc#1141174).\n\n- Fixed e2e failures in the dashboard caused by webdriver version (bsc#1145759)\n\n- librbd always tries to acquire exclusive lock when removing image an\n  (bsc#1149093).\n\nFixes in ses-manual_en:\n\n- Added a new chapter with changelogs of Ceph releases. (bsc#1135584)\n- Rewrote rolling updates and replaced running stage.0 with manual commands to prevent infinite loop. (bsc#1134444)\n- Improved name of CaaSP to its fuller version. (bsc#1151439)\n- Verify which OSD's are going to be removed before running stage.5. (bsc#1150406)\n- Added two additional steps to recovering an OSD. (bsc#1147132)\n\nFixes in ceph-iscsi:\n\n- Validate kernel LIO controls type and value (bsc#1140491)\n- TPG lun_id persistence (bsc#1145618)\n- Target level CHAP authentication (bsc#1145617)\n\nceph-iscsi was updated to the upstream 3.2 release:\n\n- Always use host FQDN instead of shortname\n- Validate min/max value for target controls and rbd:user/tcmu-runner image\n  controls (bsc#1140491)\n\n",
